.SH "NAME"
mkvextract \- extract tracks from Matroska(TM) files into other files
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBmkvextract\fR\ 'u
\fBmkvextract\fR {mode} {source\-filename} [options] [extraction\-spec]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
This program extracts specific parts from a
Matroska(TM)
file to other useful formats\&. The first argument,
\fBmode\fR, tells
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
what to extract\&. Currently supported is the extraction of
tracks,
tags,
attachments,
chapters,
CUE sheets
and
timecodes\&. The second argument is the name of the source file\&. It must be a
Matroska(TM)
file\&. All following arguments are options and extraction specifications; both of which depend on the selected mode\&.
.SS "Common options"
.PP
The following options are available in all modes and only described once in this section\&.
.PP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-parse\-fully\fR
.RS 4
Sets the parse mode to \*(Aqfull\*(Aq\&. The default mode does not parse the whole file but uses the meta seek elements for locating the required elements of a source file\&. In 99% of all cases this is enough\&. But for files that do not contain meta seek elements or which are damaged the user might have to use this mode\&. A full scan of a file can take a couple of minutes while a fast scan only takes seconds\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-command\-line\-charset\fR \fIcharacter\-set\fR
.RS 4
Sets the character set to convert strings given on the command line from\&. It defaults to the character set given by system\*(Aqs current locale\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-output\-charset\fR \fIcharacter\-set\fR
.RS 4
Sets the character set to which strings are converted that are to be output\&. It defaults to the character set given by system\*(Aqs current locale\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-redirect\-output\fR \fIfile\-name\fR
.RS 4
Writes all messages to the file
\fIfile\-name\fR
instead of to the console\&. While this can be done easily with output redirection there are cases in which this option is needed: when the terminal reinterprets the output before writing it to a file\&. The character set set with
\fB\-\-output\-charset\fR
is honored\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-ui\-language\fR \fIcode\fR
.RS 4
Forces the translations for the language
\fIcode\fR
to be used (e\&.g\&. \*(Aqde_DE\*(Aq for the German translations)\&. It is preferable to use the environment variables
\fILANG\fR,
\fILC_MESSAGES\fR
and
\fILC_ALL\fR
though\&. Entering \*(Aqlist\*(Aq as the
\fIcode\fR
will cause
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
to output a list of available translations\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-debug\fR \fItopic\fR
.RS 4
Turn on debugging for a specific feature\&. This option is only useful for developers\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-engage\fR \fIfeature\fR
.RS 4
Turn on experimental features\&. A list of available features can be requested with
\fBmkvextract \-\-engage list\fR\&. These features are not meant to be used in normal situations\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-gui\-mode\fR
.RS 4
Turns on GUI mode\&. In this mode specially\-formatted lines may be output that can tell a controlling GUI what\*(Aqs happening\&. These messages follow the format \*(Aq#GUI#message\*(Aq\&. The message may be followed by key/value pairs as in \*(Aq#GUI#message#key1=value1#key2=value2\&...\*(Aq\&. Neither the messages nor the keys are ever translated and always output in English\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
.RS 4
Be verbose and show all the important
Matroska(TM)
elements as they\*(Aqre read\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show usage information and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Show version information and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-check\-for\-updates\fR
.RS 4
Checks online for new releases by downloading the URL
\m[blue]\fBhttp://mkvtoolnix\-releases\&.bunkus\&.org/latest\-release\&.xml\fR\m[]\&. Four lines will be output in
key=value
style: the URL from where the information was retrieved (key
version_check_url), the currently running version (key
running_version), the latest release\*(Aqs version (key
available_version) and the download URL (key
download_url)\&.
.sp
Afterwards the program exists with an exit code of 0 if no newer release is available, with 1 if a newer release is available and with 2 if an error occured (e\&.g\&. if the update information could not be retrieved)\&.
.sp
This option is only available if the program was built with support for libcurl\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB@\fR\fIoptions\-file\fR
.RS 4
Reads additional command line arguments from the file
\fIoptions\-file\fR\&. Lines whose first non\-whitespace character is a hash mark (\*(Aq#\*(Aq) are treated as comments and ignored\&. White spaces at the start and end of a line will be stripped\&. Each line must contain exactly one option\&.
.sp
Several chars can be escaped, e\&.g\&. if you need to start a non\-comment line with \*(Aq#\*(Aq\&. The rules are described in
the section about escaping text\&.
.sp
The command line \*(Aq\fBmkvextract tracks source\&.mkv \-\-raw 1:destination\&.raw\fR\*(Aq could be converted into the following option file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# Extract a track from source\&.mkv

source\&.mkv
# Output the track as raw data\&.
\-\-raw

.PP
The following command line options are available for each track in the \*(Aqtracks\*(Aq extraction mode\&. They have to appear in front of the track specification (see below) they should be applied to\&.
.PP
\fB\-c\fR \fIcharacter\-set\fR
.RS 4
Sets the character set to convert the next text subtitle track to\&. Only valid if the next track ID targets a text subtitle track\&. It defaults to UTF\-8\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-blockadd\fR \fIlevel\fR
.RS 4
Keep only the BlockAdditions up to this level\&. The default is to keep all levels\&. This option only affects certain kinds of codecs like WAVPACK4\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cuesheet\fR
.RS 4
Causes
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
to extract a
CUE
sheet from the chapter information and tag data for the following track into a file whose name is the track\*(Aqs output name with \*(Aq\&.cue\*(Aq appended to it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-raw\fR
.RS 4
Extracts the raw data into a file without any container data around it\&. Unlike the
\fB\-\-fullraw\fR
flag this flag does not cause the contents of the
CodecPrivate
element to be written to the file\&. This mode works with all
CodecIDs, even the ones that
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
doesn\*(Aqt support otherwise, but the resulting files might not be usable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-fullraw\fR
.RS 4
Extracts the raw data into a file without any container data around it\&. The contents of the
CodecPrivate
element will be written to the file first if the track contains such a header element\&. This mode works with all
CodecIDs, even the ones that
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
doesn\*(Aqt support otherwise, but the resulting files might not be usable\&.
.RE
.PP
\fITID:outname\fR
.RS 4
Causes extraction of the track with the ID

\fBmkvmerge\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fB\-\-identify\fR
option\&.
.sp
Each output name should be used only once\&. The exception are RealAudio and RealVideo tracks\&. If you use the same name for different tracks then those tracks will be saved in the same file\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.RS 4
Causes extraction of the attachment with the ID
\fIAID\fR

\fIoutname\fR
if such an attachment exists in the source file\&. If the
\fIoutname\fR

.SH "OUTPUT REDIRECTION"

Several extraction modes cause

to write the extracted data to the console\&. There are generally two ways of writing this data into a file: one provided by the shell and one provided by
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)
itself\&.
.PP
The shell\*(Aqs builtin redirection mechanism is used by appending \*(Aq> output\-filename\&.ext\*(Aq to the command line\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\

.\}
.nf
$ mkvextract tags source\&.mkv > tags\&.xml

.PP
\fBmkvextract\fR(1)\*(Aqs own redirection is invoked with the

On Windows you should probably use the
