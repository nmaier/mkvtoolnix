2003-11-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: When a file is being added then some information from it
	(languages, track names, file title) are kept, and the appropriate
	input boxes are pre-set with these values. Works only for formats
	that support such information (Matroska, VobSub).

	* mkvmerge: Sped up the reading of VobSub .idx files.

2003-11-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.7.5.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The VobSub .idx parser was dividing by 0 if
	a track only contained one entry.

	* mkvmerge: Fixed the timecode reader code and made it a bit more
	flexible. Added more documentation for this feature along with an
	example file (examples/example-timecodes.txt).

	* mmg: bug fix: When 'default track' is selected then all other
	tracks of the same type will have their 'default track' flag
	cleared.

	* mkvmerge: SPU packets belonging to the same timecode are grouped
	together, and the duration is extracted directly from the SPU
	stream.

2003-10-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: The VobSubs are now stripped of the MPEG program
	stream, and only the SPU packets are kept.

2003-10-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract: The Matroska reader and the OGM reader
	(mkvmerge) as well as mkvextract will discard empty or 'cleaning
	only' subtitle packets as they are appear in OGMs in order to mark
	the end of an entry.

2003-10-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added the ability to read timecodes from
	text files which override the timecodes mkvmerge calculates
	normally.

2003-10-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Add all the mandatory elements when
	extracting chapters so that the resulting XML can always be used
	directly with mkvmerge again without having to manually add
	e.g. ChapterLanguage.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix; Handle audio tracks from Matroska files with
	the CodecID A_MS/ACM correctly.

2003-10-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changes to use libmatroska's new lacing code.

2003-10-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The VobSub .idx parser was mis-calculating
	the subtitle entry frame sizes.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Vorbis packetizer was miscalculating the
	number of samples to add/remove when using audio sync.

2003-10-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a new menu entry "File -> new" which
	will clear all the current muxing settings.

	* mmg: Added support for VobSub subtitles including their
	compression options. Added the .m4a extension to the 'add file'
	dialog.

	* mmg: bug fix: Made the input boxes for file names (tags and
	chapters) editable so that their contents can be deleted.

	* mkvmerge: Adjusted the compression handling to the final content
	encoding specs.

2003-10-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Implemented generic support for frame
	compression (mostly useful for VobSub subtitles but could also be
	used for others) and the complete framework for handling content
	encodings in the Matroska reader.

2003-10-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: new feature: Dump unknown elements recursively.

2003-10-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Made the SRT reader more tolerant regarding
	empty lines.

2003-10-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.7.2.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If 'no linking' and splitting was active
	mkvmerge would abort on the start of the second output file due to
	timecodes that were calculated incorrectly.

	* mkvmerge: Implemented some speedups for a couple of container
	formats and track types (mainly AVI reader, MP3/AC3/AAC
	packetizers). Especially noticeable when splitting is active as
	well.

2003-10-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Support for extracting SBR AAC (previous
	'fix' did not actually fix this).

	* mkvextract: bug fix: All extracted subtitles where written to
	the first output file given, not to the one they were supposed to
	be written to.

2003-10-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The 'abort' button was doing nothing under
	Windows.

2003-10-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Audio, video and subtitle track selection was
	translated into the wrong command line options.

	* mkvmerge: Replaced the avilib based AVI reading functions with
	AVI classes from Cyrius.

2003-10-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.7.1.

	* Added a guide for mmg including some pictures.

2003-10-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changed the lacing strategy again. New defaults are
	NOT to write duration elements for all blocks, NOT to use time
	slices and to USE lacing for most audio tracks. This will save
	some space. The downside is that the laced frames 'lose' their
	precise timecode information. Current demuxers don't care and will
	work nevertheless. More sophisticated applications that make use
	of these advanced information (duration elements, time slices) are
	not available at the moment. All these options can be toggled by
	the user with the new/modified options --disable-lacing,
	--enable-durations and --enable-timeslices.

2003-09-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Attachments are kept when reading
	Matroska files.

2003-09-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a (nearly) full-featured chapter editor.

2003-09-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: XML chapters were not parsed correctly.

2003-09-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix/new feature: Rewrote the complete MP3
	handling. Now files with ID3 tags (both v1 and v2) are handled
	correctly. All MPEG-1 audio files (all layers) should be handled
	correctly now.

2003-09-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Support for extract HE-AAC tracks to
	.aac files. Bug fix: Missing elements (default values) are handled
	correctly for audio tracks.

2003-09-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bugfix: If attachments were given with path components
	then the path component wasn't discarded for the attachment's
	description on Windows (normally only the file name should be used
	as the attachment's name).

	* mmg: Fixed wrong order of the options --chapters,
	--chapter-language and --chapter-charset.

2003-09-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Added a lot of checks on the data given by the user so that
	invalid data is reported by mmg and not by mkvmerge.

	* mmg: Made the app a GUI app which gets rid of the "DOS box" on
	Windows.

2003-09-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bugfix: Moved the aspect ratio and FourCC input fields from
	the global tab to the input tab where they belong to.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: RealAudio can be read from Matroska
	files.

	* mkvmerge: bugfix: RealVideo was not read correctly from Matroska
	files.

	* mkvmerge: bugfix: The SRT reader would abort if there was more
	than one empty line between subtitle entries line.

	* mkvextract: bugfix: Proper BOMs are written according to the
	desired charset when extracting text subtitles.

	* Released v0.7.0.

	* mkvextract: Add an UTF-8 BOM to extracted SSA/ASS and SRT
	subtitle files. Print warnings for missing durations for text
	subtitle tracks.

2003-09-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Added a complete GUI for mkvmerge, mkvmergeGUI (mmg) based on
	the work of Florian Wagner.

2003-09-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Support for setting the track names.

	* mkvmerge: For Matroska source files: If the source contains
	chapters then these are kept unless the user specified chapters
	with --chapters.

2003-09-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Implemented an experimental VobSub reader and
	packetizer. No specs exist for these yet, though.

	* mkvmerge: Improved the support for Matroska files with tracks
	with big gaps between entries, e.g. subtitle tracks whose entries
	are a minute or more apart.

	* mkvmerge: When splitting is active and the source is a Matroska
	file then splitpoints were borked, and the first pass was slow as
	your average mole.

	* mkvmerge: The track UIDs are kept when reading Matroska files
	even when splitting is active.

2003-09-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added a QuickTime/MP4 reader. Can handle several
	QuickTime video and QuickTime audio formats as well as AAC (both
	'normal' AAC and SBR AAC).

2003-09-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight are kept intact when
	reading from a Matroska file but can be overridden with
	--aspect-ratio.

2003-08-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Wrote documentation, XML examples and the DTD for the XML
	chapter files.

	* mkvinfo: Rewrote mkvinfo to use libebml's Read() function
	instead of manually reading each and every element.

	* mkvmerge: Added support for XML based chapter files.

2003-08-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.6.5.

2003-08-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: On Windows the 'isspace()' function used to trim
	leading and trailing white spaces from tags considered some parts
	of valid UTF-8 character sequences to be white spaces as
	well. Fixed by replacing 'isspace()' with 'isblank()'. Reported
	by Liisachan.

	* mkvmerge: Support for chosing the charset and language used in
	simple chapter files. Suggestion by Liisachan.

	* Rewrote the UTF-8 conversion routines. They should now handle
	U+8000 characters correctly. Reported by Liisachan.

	* mkvmerge: Real reader: For RV40 the actual dimensions were also
	used for the aspect ratio/display dimensions. This has been fixed:
	the actual dimensions are used for PixelWidth/PixelHeight, the
	dimensions stored in the RM container are used for the aspect
	ratio/DisplayWidth & DisplayHeight. Reported by Karl Lillevold.

2003-08-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.6.4.

	* mkvextract: Support for re-creating dropped frames when
	extracting video to an AVI. Works only well if the frame durations
	in the source file are multiples of the frame rate, of course.

	* mkvmerge: The MP3 packetizer did not start at 0 with its
	timecodes. It does now. Reported by alexnoe.

	* mkvmerge: Proper support for dropped frames when reading AVI
	files. Reported by alley_cat, Horváth István.

	* mkvmerge: Fixed some missing default values in the Matroska
	reader (e.g. mono audio files). Reported by Liisachan.

2003-08-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Improved all command line parsing error messages.

	* mkvmerge: Improved the error message for the XML tag file parser
	if an invalid &-sequence is found.

	* mkvextract: Strings are postprocessed so that the special
	characters &, <, >, " are replaced by their HTML equivalents
	&amp;, &lt, &gt; and &quot;.

2003-08-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Disabled lacing by default and renamed --no-lacing to
	--enable-lacing. With all the proper info about the laced frames
	lacing is actually producing larger files than without lacing.

	* mkvmerge: Meta seek element is split into two elements. The
	first's located at the start of the file containing only a small
	number of level 1 elements. The clusters are referenced in a
	second meta seek element located at the end of the file. Removed
	the options "--meta-seek-size" and "--no-meta-seek". Added the
	option to disable that second meta seek entry,
	"--no-clusters-in-meta-seek".

2003-08-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: Backwards compatibility: Accepts S_SSA and S_ASS as
	valid CodecIDs (new CodecIDs are S_TEXT/SSA and S_TEXT/ASS).

	* mkvmerge: Bugfix: If a subtitle packet was the last packet in a
	cluster then its duration was not written resulting in a broken file.

2003-08-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: Added support for the following elements:
	KaxPrevFilename, KaxNextFilename, KaxTrackFlagEnabled,
	KaxTrackName, KaxCodecName, KaxCodecSettings, KaxCodecInfoURL,
	KaxCodecDownloadURL, KaxCodecDecodeAll, KaxTrackOverlay,
	KaxAudioPosition, KaxAudioOutputSamplingFreq, KaxVideoDisplayUnit,
	KaxVideoColourSpace, KaxVideoGamma, KaxVideoFlagInterlaced,
	KaxVideoStereoMode, KaxVideoAspectRatio, KaxClusterPosition,
	KaxClusterPrevSize, KaxBlockVirtual, KaxBlockAdditions,
	KaxBlockMore, KaxBlockAddID, KaxBlockAdditional,
	KaxReferenceVirtual, KaxSliceBlockAddID, KaxChapters,
	KaxEditionEntry, KaxChapterAtom, KaxChapterUID,
	KaxChapterTimeStart, KaxChapterTimeEnd, KaxChapterTrack,
	KaxChapterTrackNumber, KaxChapterDisplay, KaxChapterString,
	KaxChapterLanguage, KaxChapterCountry

2003-08-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.6.3.

	* mkvmerge: The Real reader accepts incomplete video packets and
	tries to re-assemble them instead of aborting with 'die: len !=
	total'.

2003-08-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Implemented a switch that has to be used for SBR AAC /
	AAC+ / HE-AAC if the source file is an AAC file and the AAC file
	contains SBR AAC data (no automatic detection possible in this case!).

2003-08-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Low bitrate AC3 tracks from Real's DNET are identified
	as A_AC3/BSID9 or A_AC3/BSID10.

	* mkvmerge: The RealMedia reader takes the number of packets into
	account when reading which results in better end-of-file detection.

2003-08-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Windows versions: Fixed a bug with files bigger than 2GB not
	being recognized. The accompanying error message was "File NAME
	has unknown type. Please have a look at the supported file
	types..."

	* all tools: Fixed a bug which would only allow Matroska files up
	to 4GB to be read. The accompanying error message was "No segment
	found" or something similar.

	* mkvinfo: Unknown elements are properly skipped now.

2003-08-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: For RV40 (RealVideo 9) the actual video dimensions are
	decoded from the first video frame.

	* Released v0.6.2.

	* mkvmerge: Video aspect ratio was set wrong if the user did not
	specify any.

	* Released v0.6.1.

	* mkvmerge: RealVideo: Support for all kinds of frames including
	"short" and "merged" frames (results are identical to Gabest's
	output).

2003-08-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: The aspect ratio setting will only cause upscaling of
	the current video dimensions which are then put into
	KaxVideoDisplayWidth and KaxVideoDisplayHeight.

	* mkvextract: Changed how the global elements are handled by
	taking the parent's size into account. This re-enables processing
	of files produced with the latest VirtualDubMod.

	* mkvmerge: Changed how the Matroska reader handles global
	elements by taking the parent's size into account. This re-enables
	processing of files produced with the latest VirtualDubMod.

	* mkvinfo: Changed how mkvinfo handles global elements by taking
	the parent's size into account. Hopefully this is now correct.

	* mkvextract: Support for MultiComment tags.

	* mkvmerge: Fixed support for reading MultiComment tags from
	XML tag files.

	* mkvmerge: Allow some slightly broken Matroska files to be
	processed correctly if the reference blocks are off by at most 1ms.

2003-08-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: MP3: Better support for other MPEG versions and layers
	(number of samples per packet).

	* mkvinfo: Added Adler32 calculation and display for frame
	contents with the -c option.

	* mkvmerge: RealAudio: "dnet" is actually byte-swapped AC3 and is
	being treated as such (re-swapped and output as AC3).

	* mkvmerge: Fixed a bug with chapters and splitting which would
	crash mkvmerge if no chapter belonged into the output file.

2003-08-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Changes for compilation with gcc 2.95.

2003-08-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.6.0.

2003-07-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	binary elements in the tags.

2003-07-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: Support for extracting chapter information.

	* mkvmerge: Added support for simple chapter files (CHAPTER01=...,
	CHAPTER01NAME=Hello World etc).

2003-07-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added support tags based on XML files.

	* mkvextract: Rewrote the command line syntax. Added extracting
	attachments and tags as new options.

	* mkvmerge: Fixed a bug in the SRT reader which would not always
	handle Unix/DOS style new line cases correctly.

2003-07-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added support for the "SegmentTitle" (general title of
	the file written).

2003-07-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoded text files
	for the SRT and SSA/ASS readers.

2003-07-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: The SSA/ASS reader ignored the --sub-charset option
	and always used the current charset to recode the subtitles.

2003-07-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added support for attaching files to the output
	file(s).

	* mkvinfo: Support for the elements dealing with attachments
	(KaxAttachments, KaxAttached, KaxFileDescription, KaxFileName,
	KaxMimeType, KaxFileData).

2003-07-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changed the RealVideo packaging method: Subpackets are
	assembled into complete packets so the demuxer does not have to do
	that anymore.

	* mkvmerge: DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight, which form the display
	aspect ratio, are now always written to ease changing them later
	without having to completely remux the file.

2003-07-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Fixed some infinite-reading-from-a-file bug that
	occured on Windows when reading SSA/ASS files.

	* mkvmerge: Fixed a bug which would mostly appear with subtitles
	that have very long ( > 60s) gaps between entries. Here the
	cluster would not been rendered properly leaving mkvmerge either
	comatose ( = endless loop) or just plain dead ( = crashing).

2003-07-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: Added support for the rest of the tags:
	KaxTagMultiComment, KaxTagMultiCommentName,
	KaxTagMultiCommentComments and KaxTagMultiCommentLanguage. Almost
	all tags have been successfully tested.

2003-07-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Added a RealMedia demuxer that can handle both RealVideo and
	RealAudio (all codecs).

2003-07-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: Added support for allmost all tags (totally untested):

	frames) when reading Matroska files.

	* mkvmerge: Implemented time slice durations , default block
	duration and block durations for slices where necessary.

2003-06-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: Support for KaxSegmentFilename, KaxTitle, KaxSlices,

	* Released v0.5.0.

	* Added 'ReferencePriority' element to the known elements for
	mkvinfo.

	* Removed "(mkvinfo) " from mkvinfo's output in order to improve
	readability and save space.

	* --sub-charset now also needs a track ID.

	* Modified the verbosity levels for mkvinfo: The seek head subentries
	and cue subentries will only be shown at level 2 to make the 
	output easier to read. 

	* The language and default track settings are now kept again if
	not overridden when reading from Matroska files.

2003-06-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Added mkvextract which can extract tracks from a Matroska file
	into other files.

2003-06-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Switched from cygwin to MinGW32 for the Windows binaries.

	* Fixed a double free() on cleanup (after writing the cues) which
	resulted in a segfault sometimes.

	* Added a SSA/ASS reader.

2003-06-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Support for reading text subtitles from Matroska files.

	* Made the AAC reader automatically recognize if a MPEG4 AAC file
	contains the emphasis header (deprecated) or not (current standard).

2003-06-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.4.4.

	* Several options now need an explicity track ID to specify
	which tracks of an input file the option should be applied
	to. These options include --atracks, --vtracks, --stracks, --sync,
	--default-track, --cues and --language.

	* The Matroska reader now handles track selection correctly.

	first and last files created can be manually linked to given UIDs.

2003-06-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Added support for splitting output files by size or by time and
	limiting the number of output files.

	MP3 and AC3 files so that those won't be mis-identified.

	* Some improvements to the mkvinfo GUI (thanks to jcsston for the
	patch/the ideas).

	* Released v0.4.2.

	* Support for some more tags in both mkvmerge and mkvinfo.

	* Fixed a segfault in the Matroska reader.

2003-05-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Better support for DTS streams in general and for DTS-in-WAV in
	particular (patch by Peter Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>).

2003-05-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	page regarding subtitle handling.

	moment).

2003-05-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* If an error occurs while writing to the destination file the
	error is reported and mkvmerge aborts with a non-zero exit code.

	* The OGM reader reported I frames as P frames and vice versa
	round making seeking not really nice ;)

2003-05-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Fixed a bug with the AC3 timecode calculation (patch by Peter
	Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>).

	(main patch by Peter Niemayer <niemayer AT isg.de>, a few things
	by me).

	on 2003-05-06 with the internal changes).

	the Matroska reader.

	rely on the current locale anymore.

	* For the last packet of each track its duration is now stored.

	* A lot of internal changes - I hope nothing has broken... (See
	ChangeLog.cvs for details.)

	* The matroska reader calculated wrong header lengths for Vorbis
	tracks.

2003-05-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>
