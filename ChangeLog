2010-09-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v4.3.0.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Appending tracks which would normally be
	compressed (e.g. with header removal compression) and turning off
	compression for those tracks with "--compression TID:none" (or the
	corresponsing option in mmg) was resulting in the second and all
	following appended tracks to be compressed all the same.

2010-09-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Errors such as 'file does not exist' did
	not cause mkvextract to quit. Instead it continued and exited with
	the result code 0.

2010-08-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Certain frames in certain h.264/AVC raw
	tracks were handled wrong, e.g. files created by x264 versions
	starting with revision 1665. The situation occured if an IDR slice
	comes immedtiately after a non-IDR slice and the IDR slice has its
	frame_num and pic_order_count_lsb fields set to 0.

2010-08-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Attachments will be rendered at the
	beginning of the file again. Fix for bug 516.

2010-08-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvpropedit, mmg's header editor: Fixed a crash corrupting files
	in certain situations. If the updated header fields required
	filling exactly one byte with an EbmlVoid element and if the next
	Matroska element's "size" was already written with its maximum
	length (8 bytes) then the crash would occur. Such files are
	written by e.g. lavf. Fix for bug 536.

2010-08-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* All: bug fix: Fixed a couple of format strings in translations
	which could cause the programs to crash.

2010-08-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: new feature: mkvinfo will show the h.264 profile and
	level for AVC/h.264 tracks along with the CodecPrivate element.

2010-08-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Video tracks with a width or height of 0 are
	not read from AVI files anymore. Fix for bug 538.

2010-08-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed an error with losing packets (error
	message "packet queue not empty") when reading IVF (VP8) files
	using --default-duration on it.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed access to uninitialized memory in the
	MPEG-2 ES parser.

2010-08-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The 'total remaining time' shown by the job
	manager was totally wrong. Fix for bug 529.

2010-08-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* build system: The build system has been changed from "make" to
	"rake", the Ruby based build tool. MKVToolNix includes its own
	copy of it so all you need is to have Ruby itself installed. The
	build proecss has been tested with Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7 and
	1.9.1. Building is pretty much the same as before: "./configure",
	"./drake", "sudo ./drake install". Most of the build targets have
	similar if not identical names, e.g. "./drake install". You can
	override variables just like with make, e.g. "./drake
	prefix=/somewhere install".

2010-07-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg header editor: bug fix: If a file was loaded that did not
	contain 'track language' elements and those elements were
	unchanged then they would be set to 'und' upon saving. Now they're
	left as-is, and when adding them to the file the drop-down box
	defaults to 'eng' being selected as per Matroska default value
	specifications. Fix for bug 525.

2010-07-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract, mkvinfo, mkvpropedit: new feature: Added the option
	"-q" and its long version "--quiet". With "--quiet" active only
	warnings and errors are output. Fix for bug 527.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The option "--quiet" was not working
	properly.

	* mkgmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge was treating SSA/ASS subtitle files
	as audio files for the purpose of track selection (--no-subtitles
	/ --no-audio). Fix for bug 526.

2010-07-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v4.2.0.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge was accessing invalid memory In
	certain cases, e.g. when appending Matroska files that use
	compression while turning compression off.

2010-07-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Splitting output files by size was basing its
	decision when to create a new file on an uninitialized
	variable. This caused effects like a lot of small files being
	created with sizes much smaller than the intended split size.

2010-07-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The speed with which mkvmerge skips garbage
	in DTS tracks has been greatly improved.

2010-07-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Reading Matroska files: DisplayWidth &
	DisplayHeight values that are obviously not meant to represent
	pixels but only to be used for aspect ratio calculation (e.g.
	16x9) are converted into proper ranges based on the track's
	PixelWidth & PixelHeight values and the quotient of DisplayWidth /
	DisplayHeight.

2010-07-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Attachments will be rendered at the end
	of the file instead of at the beginning. The attachments will be
	placed after the cues but before the chapters. Fix for bug 516.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Header removal compression has been
	enabled by default for MPEG-4 part 10 (AVC/h.264) video tracks
	with a NALU size field length of four bytes.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Header removal compression has been
	deactivated for MPEG-4 part 2 (aka DivX/Xvid) video tracks due to
	incompatibility with packed bitstreams.

2010-07-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: The taskbar progress is reset as soon as
	mkvmerge finishes/as soon as all jobs are done (Windows 7).

2010-07-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed reading AVC/h.264 tracks from AVI files
	if they're stored without NALUs inside the AVI. Was broken by a
	fix for handling AVC/h.264 in NALUs inside AVI.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: All readers that only handled file formats
	which do not contain more than one track did not respect the
	"--no-audio / --no-video / --no-subtitles" options. This applied
	to the following readers: AAC, AC3, AVC/h.264, CorePicture, Dirac,
	DTS, FLAC, IVF, MP3, MPEG ES, PGS/SUP, SRT, SSA, TrueHD, TTA, VC1,
	WAV and WavPack.

2010-07-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Improved reading text files that use
	mixed end-of-line styles (DOS & Unix mixed).

2010-07-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed invalid memory access in the PCM
	packetizer. Fix for bug 510.

	* mmg: bug fix: When mmg starts it will check the entries in the
	file and chapter menu's list of recently used files and remove
	those entries that no longer exist. Fix for bug 509.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a crash when reading Matroska files
	that were damaged in a certain way.

2010-07-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v4.1.1.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed invalid memory access in the header
	removal compressor. Fix for bug 508.

	* mmg: bug fix: mmg will no longer add .mmg files opened by the
	job runner to the file menu's list of recently opened files. Fix
	for bug 509.

2010-07-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v4.1.0.

2010-06-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed reading AVC/h.264 tracks from AVI files
	if they're stored in NALUs inside the AVI.

2010-06-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Build system: enhancement: Improved the error reporting if
	certain Boost libraries are not found.

2010-06-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: mkvmerge will report if it finds data
	errors in a Matroska file (e.g. due to storage failure or bad
	downloads). The position is reported as well as a periodic update
	as long as mkvmerge re-syncs to the next Matroska element.

	* mmg: enhancement: The "compression" drop down box is enabled for
	all track types. That way "no compression" can be forced for those
	tracks mkvmerge uses "header removal" compression for.

2010-06-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Matroska files read from/written to by the header
	and chapter editors will no longer be kept opened and locked. Fix
	for bug 498.

	* mmg: bug fix: If mmg was called with "--edit-headers
	filename.mkv" then it crashed when the header editor was closed.

2010-06-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: mkvmerge will start a new cluster before
	a key frame of the first video track. Fix for bug 500.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: The default cluster length has been
	increased to five seconds (up from two seconds).

2010-06-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge will no longer report nonsensical
	progress reports (e.g. -17239182%) when reading Matroska files
	with all the flags "--no-audio --no-video --no-subtitles"
	enabled. Fix for bug 505.

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed a crash in the job runner when the total
	time was very big due to a division by zero.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Implemented write caching resulting in
	faster muxes especially on Windows writing to network shares.

2010-06-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for reading PGS subtitles
	from PGS/SUP files.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Specifying an FPS with "--default-duration"
	for AVC/h264 tracks in AVI files did not work. Fix for bug 492.

2010-06-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed an invalid memory access possibly
	causing a crash in the AC3 detection code.

2010-06-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Changing mmg's interface language did not change
	the entries in the "command line options" dialog if that dialog
	had been opened prior to the language change.

2010-06-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: mkvmerge uses header removal compression
	by default for AC3, DTS, MP3, Dirac and MPEG-4 part 2 tracks.

	* all: Added desktop files for mmg/mkvinfo, a MIME type file for
	.mmg files and icons to the installation procedure on Linux. Most
	files were contributed by Cristian Morales Vega (see AUTHORS).

	* all: Added a translation of the programs into Spanish by Isra
	Lucas (see AUTHORS).

2010-06-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	reading DTS tracks from AVI and Matroska files.

2010-06-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Matroska reader will use the MPEG audio
	packetizer for MP2 tracks instead of the passthrough packetizer.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Matroska reader did not handle compressed
	tracks correctly if the passthrough packetizer was used.

2010-06-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* docs: Added a Dutch translation for the man pages by René
	Maassen (see AUTHORS).

2010-06-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	older than v1.1.1.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed support for reading FLAC tracks from
	Ogg files following the FLAC-in-Ogg-mapping established with FLAC

2010-05-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: The "mkvmerge executable" input in the
	preferences dialog is not read-only anymore. Final part of a fix
	for bug 490.

	will be shown in a scrollable dialog instead of a normal message
	box. Part of a fix for bug 490.

	* mmg: Added 'IVF' files to the list of known input file types.

	* mkvmerge: Added support for reading IVF files with VP8 video
	tracks.

	* mkvextract: Added support for extracting VP8 video tracks into
	IVF files.

2010-05-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvinfo, mkvextract: bug fix: Fixed handling of
	clusters missing a cluster timecode element.

	wrong place in the element tree.

2010-05-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract: Fixed handling of clusters with an unknown
	size.

2010-05-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Fixed handling clusters with an unknown size.

	* mkvinfo: new feature: Added an option ("-z" / "--size") for
	displaying each element's size property. Elements with an
	unknown/infinite size are shown as "size is unknown".

2010-05-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a checkbox for enabling "WebM"
	mode. This will also enable the same limitations that mkvmerge
	enables: Only VP8 and Vorbis tracks, no chapters, no tags. The
	output file name extension will be changed to ".webm" upon
	enabling the mode.

2010-05-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: change: mkvmerge will not write track header elements
	whose actual value equals their default value anymore.

2010-05-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Neither chapters nor tags will be written
	to WebM compliant files. Warnings are issued if chapters or
	tags are found and not disabled.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Matroska files without clusters are accepted
	as valid input files again.

	* mmg: enhancement: Added "WebM" with the extension "webm" to
	the list of known file types.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for muxing VP8 video
	tracks.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: mkvmerge will no longer put all clusters
	into a meta seek element resulting in smaller file size. The
	parameter "--no-clusters-in-meta-seek" has been renamed to
	"--clusters-in-meta-seek" and its meaning reverted.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: WebM compatibility mode will be
	turned on automatically if the output file name's extension is
	'.webm', '.webma' or '.webmv'.

	* mkvinfo GUI: enhancement: Added "webm" to the list of known file
	name extensions for WebM files both for the "Open file" dialog
	and the drag & drop support.

2010-05-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added options "--webm"/"--web-media" that
	enable the WebM compatibility mode. In this mode only Vorbis
	audio tracks and VP8 video tracks are allowed. Neither chapters
	nor tags are allowed. The DocType element is set to "webm".

	* mkvinfo GUI: bug fix: Opening more than one file without
	restarting mkvinfo GUI could result in wrong timecodes due to
	variables not being reinitialized.

2010-05-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Binary elements shorter than 10 bytes were not
	output correctly.

2010-05-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Build system: bug fix: The man page installation process only
	installed the English originals instead of the Japanese and
	Chinese translations.

2010-05-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v3.4.0.

	* build: Building mkvtoolnix now requires libebml v0.8.0 and

	on OpenSolaris.

2010-02-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Installer: bug fix: The "jobs" directory in the application data
	folder is removed during uninstallation if the user requests
	it. Fix for bug 474.

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Fixed granulepos calculation when
	extracting Vorbis tracks into Ogg files. Fix for bug 473.

2010-02-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	message if a selected interface translation is not available. The
	"C" locale is used instead. Fix for bug 472.

2010-02-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract: enhancement: Improved the error resilience
	when dealing with damaged Matroska files. When a damaged part is
	encountered reading will continue at the next cluster.

2010-02-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the handling of UTF-16 encoded chapter
	names in MP4/MOV files.

2010-02-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Some Matroska files contain h.264/AVC
	tracks lacking their CodecPrivate element (e.g. files created by
	gstreamer's muxer). For such tracks the CodecPrivate element (the
	AVCC) is re-created from the bitstream. Fix for bug 470.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: MP4 files that do contain edit lists but
	whose edit lists do not span the entire file are processed
	properly. Such files are created by current x264 builds. Fix for
	bug 469.

2010-02-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Build system: Fixed configure for systems on which 'echo' does
	not support the '-n' parameter (e.g. Mac OS).

2010-02-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v3.2.0.

2010-02-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Build system: bug fix: Improved detection of Boost::Filesystem
	for newer Boost versions.

2010-02-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* docs: Added a Chinese Simplified translation for the man pages
	by Dean Lee (see AUTHORS).

2010-02-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Outputting error messages about invalid XML
	files will not cause mkvmerge to crash on Windows anymore.

	* mmg: enhancement: Added an input field for the segment info XML
	file (mkvmerge's "--segmentinfo" option) on the "global" tab.

2010-02-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The jobs will be saved in the 'mkvtoolnix/jobs'
	sub-directory of the 'application data' folder instead of the
	'jobs' folder in the current directory. On Windows this is the
	special 'application data' folder inside the user's profile
	directory, e.g. 'C:\Users\mbunkus\AppData\mkvtoolnix'. On
	non-Windows systems this is the folder '.mkvtoolnix' in the user's
	home directory.
	mmg's configuration file has also been moved from ~/.mkvmergeGUI
	to ~/.mkvtoolnix/config on non-Windows systems.
	Fix for bug 466.

2010-01-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Files are only opened for reading, not for
	writing, so that mkvextract will work on files the user only has
	read-only permissions for.

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Modes 'attachments', 'chapters', 'tags' and
	'cuesheet': mkvextract will output an error message if the file
	cannot be opened (e.g. because it does not exist or due to lack of
	access).

2010-01-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: Changing the interface language does not
	require a restart anymore.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Reading VOB files bigger than 4 GB was broken
	in v3.1.0 on 32bit platforms.

2010-01-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Tooltips were not word-wrapped on Windows.

	* mkvinfo: enhancement: Added the "EBML maximum size length"
	element to the list of known elements. Fix for bug 464.

2010-01-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a control for mkvmerge's "--cropping"
	parameter.

	* mmg: enhancement: Added the file extensions ".dtshd", ".dts-hd",
	".truehd" and ".true-hd" to mmg's"'add/append file" dialogs.

	* mkvextract: bug fix: "mkvextract --version" was only writing an
	empty string. Fix for bug 463.

2010-01-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v3.1.0.

2010-01-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If the first input file was a Quicktime/MP4
	file and all tracks from that file were deselected for muxing then
	mkvmerge would crash. Fix for bug 458.

2010-01-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The option 'AAC is SBR/HE-AAC' was not honored
	for appended AAC tracks. This could lead to mkvmerge aborting with
	an error that the track parameters did not match if it itself
	could not detect HE-AAC in the second file.

2010-01-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* documentation: Added a Chinese Simplified translation for mmg's
	guide by Dean Lee (see AUTHORS).

2010-01-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* documentation: Added a Japanese translation for the man pages by
	Katsuhiko Nishimra (see AUTHORS).

2010-01-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The output file name is checked for invalid
	characters before the muxing process is started. Fix for bug 455.

	* mkvpropedit, mmg: bug fix: Files with an infinite segment size
	are handled correctly now. Fix for bug 438.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Matroska files which have its 'tracks'
	element located behind the clusters are read correctly now.

	* mmg: enhancement: After muxing the "abort" button is changed to
	"open folder" which opens the explorer on the output file's
	folder. This only happens on Windows.

2010-01-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: When constructing the output file name mmg
	will only suggest names that don't exist already by appending a
	number to the file name (e.g. resulting in "/path/file (1).mkv").

2009-12-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for reading chapters from
	MP4 files that are stored in tracks with subtype 'text'. Such
	files are used e.g. on iPods/iPhones and can be created by
	HandBrake. Fix for bug 454.

2009-12-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The "tags" input box on the "general track
	options" tab was not updated when a track was selected. Fix for
	bug 453.

2009-12-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mmg: new feature: If a MPEG-2 program stream file is
	added to mkvmerge whose base name ends in a number then mkvmerge
	will automatically read and process all other files in the same
	directory with the same base name, same extension and different
	numbers. Those files are treated as if they were a single big
	file. This applies e.g.  to VOB files from DVD images that are
	named VTS_01_1.VOB, VTS_01_2.VOB, VTS_01_3.VOB etc. mmg will
	output an error message if the user tries to add or append one of
	the other files that mkvmerge will process automatically (e.g. if
	the user has added VTS_01_1.VOB already and tries to append
	VTS_01_2.VOB).

	This also fixes bug 437.

	* Build requirements changed: mkvtoolnix requires Boost v1.34.0 or
	later. It requires the Boost::Filesystem library (with all Boost
	versions) and the Boost::System libraries (starting with Boost
	v1.35.0).

2009-12-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: SRT files with negative timecodes will
	are not rejected anymore. Negative timecodes will be adjusted to
	start at 00:00:00.000.

2009-12-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added support for extracting Blu-Ray
	subtitles (CodecID "S_HDMV/PGS").

2009-12-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge/mmg: enhancement: Added an option '--segment-uid' for
	specifying the segment UIDs to use instead of having to use a XML
	file and '--segmentinfo'.

	* Installer: The installer will no longer offer to run mmg after
	it has been installed. On Windows setups where a normal user
	account doesn't have administrator privileges this caused mmg to
	be run as the user "Administrator" instead of the normal user
	account causing confusion and some things not to work, e.g. drag &
	drop.

2009-12-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Zero-length frames in Theora bitstreams as
	created by libtheora v1.1 and later were dropped. Fix for bug
	450.

2009-12-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: On Windows 2000/XP the 'add/append file' dialog
	was not showing files with certain extensions (e.g. ".srt" or
	".mp4") if the option "all supported media files" was
	selected. Fix for bug 448.

2009-12-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v3.0.0.

	* mmg: enhancement: Added support for showing the muxing progress
	for both normal muxes and the job manager in Windows 7's taskbar.

2009-12-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: bug fix: The charset for output in cmd.exe for non-English
	interface languages has been fixed on Windows Vista and Windows 7.

	* all: enhancement for Windows platforms: If one of the mkvtoolnix
	components is run without having been installed before then
	translations will be read from the directory the .exe is run
	from.

2009-12-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* configure: Added an option ('--without-build-timestamp') that
	omits the build timestamp from all version information so that two
	builds of mkvtoolnix can be byte-identical.

2009-12-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvpropedit, mmg: bug fix: Editing headers of files created by
	HandBrake would cause crashes and/or corrupted files after
	saving. Fix for bug 445.

2009-11-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.9.9.

2009-11-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The warning that no FPS has been entered for
	AVC/h.264 elementary streams is not shown anymore for appended
	tracks (only once for the first track that they're appended to).

2009-10-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The pixel cropping parameters were not kept
	when muxing from Matroska files.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The display width/height parameters were not
	kept when muxing from Matroska files if the bitstream of the track
	contained different aspect ratio information. Now the order is
	"command line" first, "source container" second and "bitstream"
	last.

2009-09-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the subtitle track selection for AVI
	files.

2009-08-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: A single '+' causes the next file to be
	appended just like putting the '+' in front of the file name.

2009-08-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The integrated help ('--help') contained
	wrong information about the '--sync' option. Fix for bug 435.

2009-08-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: The file dialogs for 'add file'/'append file'
	will show files with extensions in all uppercase as well. This
	only applies to file systems that distinguish between case
	(e.g. most of the non-Windows, non-FAT world). Fix for bug 433.

2009-08-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Missing ChapterLanguage elements were assumed
	to be set to "und". They're now assumed to be "eng" in accordance
	with the Matroska specifications.

	* Added a new program 'mkvpropedit' that can modify certain
	properties of existing Matroska files. It is mmg's header editor,
	just for the command line.

2009-08-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.9.8.

	* mmg: bug fix: The inputs for timecode files and the language are
	deactivated if the user has selected a track that will be appended
	to another track. Fix for bug 432.

2009-08-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: mmg will handle multiple consecutive spaces in the
	options given with "add command line options" properly and not
	cause mkvmerge to exit with misleading error messages anymore. The
	"add command line options" dialog has been reordered, and the drop
	down box in it is now read-only. Fixes for bug 429.

	* doc, mmg: bug fix: The tooltip and documentation for the 'delay'
	option was misleading. Fix for bug 420.

2009-07-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg/header editor: enhancement: Implemented a considerable
	speedup in the processing of large files.

2009-07-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg/header editor: bug fix: The header editor copes better with
	files that do not contain all mandatory header fields. The missing
	ones are added or assumed to be default values.

2009-07-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: bug fix: Selecting the translations with the
	"--ui-language" option did not work on Mac OS X.

2009-07-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed an invalid memory access in the VobSub
	reader module. Fix for bug 426.

	* mmg: bug fix: Tracks added from Matroska files did not get their
	'default track' drop down box set correctly if the flag was 'off'
	in the source file and no other track of its kind hat its 'default
	track' flag set.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge was wrongly turning the 'default
	track' flag back on for the first subtitle track muxed from a
	Matroska file if none of the subtitle tracks muxed had their
	'default track' flag set in their source files and if the user
	didn't use the '--default-track' option for setting that flag
	explicitely.

2009-07-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Running mkvmerge on Windows from an installation
	directory with two spaces in the path (e.g. "C:\Program
	Files\Video tools\mkvtolnix") crashed mmg when the user started
	muxing. Fix for bug 419.

2009-07-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Files for which all tracks were disabled were left
	out from mkvmerge's command line so that tags, chapters and
	attachments were not copied from such files either.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Appending MPEG4 part 2 video tracks from
	Matroska files which contain aspect ratio information will not
	result in an error message "connected_to > 0" anymore. Fix for bug
	427.

2009-07-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the audio sync for tracks read from AVI
	files containing garbage at the beginning. Fix for bug 421.

	* mmg: bug fix: Trying to save chapters that contain editions
	without a single chapter entry does no longer result in a crash
	but a descriptive error message instead. Saving empty chapters to
	a Matroska file will remove all chapters contained in the file
	instead of not doing anything. Fixes for bug 422.

2009-07-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: enhancement: Implemented speed-ups of up to 50% for
	middle to larger files.

2009-07-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed reading AVC/h.264 video tracks from OGM
	files. Fix for bug 418.

	* mmg: bug fix: The chapter language for chapters copied from
	source files (e.g. Matroska, MP4 or OGM files) is only changed if
	the user has selected any language other than "und". Fix for bug
	420.

	* mmg: bug fix: mmg will no longer show an error message if the
	user has not selected a country in the "chapters" tab of the
	preferences dialog.

2009-07-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.9.7.

2009-06-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The handling of NVOPs in native MPEG4 part 2
	video storage has been improved. NVOPs are dropped again both from
	packed and non-packed bitstreams, and timecodes are adjusted to
	match the number of dropped frames.

2009-06-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: The "preferences" dialog has been split up into several
	tabs. Some other preferences available in other dialogs have been
	merged into the "preferences" dialog.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The I frame detection for AVC/h.264 video has
	been fixed. Sometimes a single I frame was recognized as two or
	more consecutive I frames resulting in garbled display and wrong
	timestamps. Fix for bug 415.

2009-06-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: The list of common languages can be configured
	by the user via the 'preferences' dialog.

2009-06-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: bug fix: The programs do not try to close iconv handles -1
	anymore which resulted in segfault during uninitialization on some
	platforms (e.g. FreeBSD, Mac OS X). Fix for bug 412.

2009-06-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Complete rewrite of the code for the native
	storage mode for MPEG4 part 2 video tracks. Fix for bug 298.

2009-06-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Made the detection rules for raw MP3, AC3 and
	AAC audio files more strict. This avoids a mis-detection of
	certain files, e.g. AVC/h.264 ES files being misdetected as MP3
	files. Fix for bug 414.

2009-06-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Appending MP4 or OGM files with chapters will
	merge the chapters from all appended files and not just take the
	chapters from the first file and discard the chapters from the
	following files. Fix for bug 397.

	* mkvmerge, mmg: new feature: The language for chapters read from
	files such as OGM and MP4 files can be chosen with the
	--chapter-language command line option. Fix for bug 399.

	* mkvmerge, mmg: new feature: Chapter and tag information
	contained in source files are now shown in the "track" selection
	box and can be toggled individually. The user can set the charset
	for chapters if the source file's chapters are not encoded in
	UTF-8 (e.g. in some OGM/MP4 files). The old file specific
	checkboxes "no tags" and "no chapters" have been removed. Fix for
	bug 400.

2009-06-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The chapter editor was corrupting Matroska files
	if the chapters were saved to a file twice in a row without
	reloading them from the Matroska file.

2009-06-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: If the user selects the option "Verify" from
	the "Chapters" menu then a message will be shown even if the
	validation succeeded. Fix for bug 410.

	* mmg/mkvmerge: bug fix: Adding MP4 files with chapter entries
	that are not encoded in UTF-8 will not result in mkvmerge aborting
	with a message about invalid UTF-8 sequences anymore. Fix for bug
	408.

2009-06-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.9.5.

2009-06-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The handling of TrueHD/MLP audio in MPEG
	program streams was broken resulting in many dropped packets.

	* all: bug fix: There was the possibility that invalid memory
	access occured and e.g. mkvmerge crashed on systems with the
	posix_fadvise() function (mainly Linux) if mkvmerge was opening
	several files from certain file systems (e.g. VFAT). Apart from
	obvious crashes the only other side effect was that the
	posix_fadvise() function would not be used resulting in slightly
	worse I/O performance.

2009-05-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Improved the control over which tags get
	copied from a source file to the output file. The old option
	"--no-tags" was replaced with the new options "--no-global-tags"
	which causes global tags not to be copied and "--no-track-tags"
	which causes track specific tags to not be copied. The new option
	"--track-tags" can be used to select tracks for which tags will be
	copied. The default is still to copy all existing tags.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Included chapters, global and track
	specific tracks in the output of mkvmerge's identification mode.

	* mkvmerge: Renamed a couple of command line options to make the
	command line interface more consistent: "--no-audio",
	"--no-video", "--no-subtitles", "--no-buttons", "--audio-tracks",
	"--video-tracks", "--subtitle-tracks", "--button-tracks". The old
	versions of these options "--noaudio", "--novideo", "--nosubs",
	"--nobuttons", "--atracks", "--vtracks", "--stracks" and
	"--btracks" still work.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The sequence header of MPEG-1/2 video tracks
	is put into the CodecPrivate again while still leaving sequence
	headers in the bitstream as well. This is more compatible with
	some existing parsers.

2009-05-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Removed the check if the user has added
	tracks and files before starting mkvmerge because mkvmerge itself
	is able to create track-less files (e.g. chapters only). Fix for
	bug 402.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Improved the handling of consecutive AC3
	packets with the same timecode (e.g. if AC3 is read from MP4
	files). Fix for bug 403.

2009-05-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed an endless loop in the TrueHD code
	occuring when the TrueHD stream is damaged somewhere.

2009-05-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the detection of MPEG transport streams
	with other packet sizes than 188 bytes (e.g. 192 and 204 bytes).

2009-05-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The detection of invalid padding packet
	lengths in the MPEG program stream reader was improved to not
	produce as many false positives. Patch by Todd Schmuland (see
	AUTHORS). Fix for bug 393.

2009-05-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for the FourCCs ".mp3" and
	"XVID" in QuickTime files.

	* mmg: bug fix: Pressing 'return' in the job dialog will close the
	dialog on Windows, too. Fix for bug 392.

2009-05-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed the behaviour of how mmg sets the output
	file name automatically if the option is enabled. If the user adds
	more than one file then the extension of the output file name is
	set each time a file is added and not only when the first one
	is. The full file name and path will only be set when the first
	file is added. Fix for bug 391.

	* Released v2.9.0.

2009-05-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: Added a translation to Traditional Chinese by Dean
	Lee (see AUTHORS).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge was not handling dropped frames well
	when converting from VfW-mode MPEG-4 part 2 to native mode MPEG-4
	part 2 (with '--engage native_mpeg4'). This resulted in timecodes
	being to low which in turn resulted in the loss of audio/video
	synchronization. Fix for bug 236.

2009-05-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The modes 'chapters', 'cuesheet' and 'tags'
	did not honor the '--redirect-output' option and where always
	writing to the standard output.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added a hack ('vobsub_subpic_stop_cmds')
	that causes mkvmerge to add 'stop display' commands to VobSub
	subtitle packets that do not have a duration field. Patch by Todd
	Schmuland (see AUTHORS).

2009-05-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: Changed how mmg sets the output file name
	automatically if the option is enabled. If the user adds more than
	one file then the output file name is set each time a file is
	added and not only when the first one is unless the user has
	changed the output file name manually. Fix for bug 229.

2009-05-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Improved support for QuickTime audio
	tracks with version 2 of the STSD sound descriptor.

	* mmg: bug fix: The "remove all" button was sometimes disabled
	even though there were still files left to be removed.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: The MPEG program stream reader will now
	detect invalid padding packets and skip only to the next 2048 byte
	packet boundary instead of skipping several good packets. Patch by
	Todd Schmuland (see AUTHORS).

	* mmg: enhancement: The "no chapters" checkbox can now be used for
	QuickTime/MP4 files and OGM files as well.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: The OGM reader will only print the
	warning that no chapter charset has been set by the user if the
	title or the chapter information contained in the OGM file is
	actually used and not overwritten with '--title ...' or
	'--no-chapters'.

2009-05-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The VobSub extraction was made more
	compatible with most applications. Fix for bug 245. Patch by Todd
	Schmuland (see AUTHORS).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed support for Windows systems that use
	code pages that are not supported by the iconv library (e.g. code
	page 720). mkvmerge was exiting with warnings causing mmg to
	report that file identification had failed. Fix for bug 376.

2009-05-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for handling MPEG-1/-2
	video in AVI files. Fix for bug 388.

2009-05-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: bug fix: Global variables are deconstructed in a
	pre-defined way no longer causing segfaults when the programs are
	about to exit.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Implemented small speedups for some
	common memory operation (affects e.g. the MPEG program stream
	parser).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed potential and actual segmentation
	faults occuring when appending VC-1 video tracks, Dirac video
	tracks and DTS audio tracks.

2009-05-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The header and chapter editors will no longer
	crash the application if the user wants to open a file that's
	locked by another process and show an error message instead.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Invalid VobSub packets whose internal SPU
	length field differs from its actual length are patched so that
	the SPU length field matches the actual length. This fixes
	playback issues with several players and filters. Fix for bug
	383.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for reading chapters from
	MP4 files. Fix for bug 385.

2009-05-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.8.0.

2009-05-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: Added a translation to Chinese (simplified) by Dean
	Lee (see AUTHORS).

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Added support for handling AC3 audio in
	MP4 files with the FourCC "sac3" (as created by e.g. Nero Recode
	v3/4). Fix for bug 384.

	* mkvmerge, mmg: enhancement: Made mmg's "FPS" input field
	available for all video tracks. mkvmerge's corresponding option
	"--default-duration" now not only modifies the track header field
	but affects the frame timecodes as well.

2009-05-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The VobSub reader was dropping the very last
	MPEG packet possibly resulting in the very last subtitle entry
	being garbled or discarded completely. Patch by Todd Schmuland.

2009-05-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: Added "60000/1001" as a pre-defined option to
	the "FPS" drop-down box.

2009-04-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg (header editor): bug fix: The header editor controls on the
	right stopped responding after the second file had been loaded or
	the "reload file" feature had been used. Fix for bug 372.

2009-04-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>
	* mmg: new feature: Added an option for clearing all inputs after
	a successful muxing run.

2009-04-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>
	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Made the AAC detection code stricter in what
	it accepts. This results in fewer mis-detections. Fix for bugs 373
	and 374.

2009-04-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Splitting without the option "--engage
	no_simpleblocks" resulted in broken files: all frames were marked
	as B frames. Fix for bug 371.

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Timecodes of SimpleBlock elements that were
	output formatted in summary mode were too small by a factor of
	1000000.

2009-04-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The duration of subtitle frames was
	overwritten with the difference between the next frame's timecode
	and the current frame's timecode if a timecode file was used for
	that track. Fix for bug 286.

	* mmg: bug fix: Removed the option "always use simple blocks" from
	the preferences dialog as this option was already removed from
	mkvmerge. Fix for bug 370.

2009-04-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.7.0.

	* Build requirements changed: mkvtoolnix requires Boost v1.32.0 or
	later.

2009-04-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: mkvmerge will now use SimpleBlock elements instead of
	normal BlockGroup elements by default.

2009-04-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mmg: new feature: Added support for the "forced track"
	flag. Fix for bug 128.

	* mmg: bug fix: The header editor and chapter editor will not
	write zero bytes anymore if there's not enough space to write an
	EbmlVoid element when saving to Matroska files.

2009-04-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: By default mkvmerge keeps the aspect ratio information
	in AVC/h.264 video bitstreams now (equivalent to specifying
	"--engage keep_bitstream_ar_info" in earlier versions). A new
	option "--engage remove_bitstream_ar_info" is available that
	restores the previous behaviour.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the aspect ratio extraction for
	AVC/h.264 video by adding three more pre-defined sample aspect
	ratios. Mkvmerge also only assumes "free aspect ratio" if the
	aspect ratio type information indicates it and not if the
	type information is unknown.

2009-04-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added drag & drop support for the header
	editor (files can be opened by dropping them on the header
	editor).

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for reading the track
	language from QuickTime/MP4 files. Thanks to Eduard Bloch for the
	code for unpacking the language string.

	* mmg: bug fix: All arguments are shell escaped and quoted instead
	of only those with spaces in them. Only applies to the menu
	options "show command line", "save command line to file" and "copy
	command line to clipboard". Fix for bug 364.

2009-03-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract: new feature: Added support for MLP audio.

	* mmg: bug fix: When adding a file with colons in the segment
	title all colons were replaced with the letter 'c'.

2009-03-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvetract: new feature: Added support for TrueHD audio
	(read from raw streams with or without embedded AC3 frames, MPEG
	program streams).

2009-03-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The job manager's status output was garbled if mmg
	was run with another language as English.

	* mmg: bug fix: The progress bar for each individual job in the
	job dialog wasn't updated if mmg was run with another language as
	English.

	* mmg: bug fix: The timecodes in the job queue editor were off by
	one month. The "added job on" was additionally off by an amount
	depending on the user's time zone. Fix for bug 362.

2009-03-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The MPEG program stream (VOB/EVO) reader was
	sometimes reading the timecodes wrong resulting in bad audio/video
	synchronization. Fix for bug 337.

	* Released v2.6.0.

2009-03-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a header editor for Matroska files.

2009-03-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The "simple" chapter extraction mode (OGM
	style chapter output) outputs strings converted to the system's
	current charset by default now instead of always converting to
	UTF-8. This can be overridden with the "--output-charset" command
	line option. Fix for bug 359.

2009-03-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: QuickTime audio tracks will be stored with
	the CodecID "A_QUICKTIME". The CodecPrivate element contains the
	full "STSD" element from the QuickTime file (just like
	V_QUICKTIME). This method is used for all audio tracks which don't
	have a well-defined storage spec for Matroska (e.g. AAC, AC3,
	MP2/3 are still stored as A_AC3, A_AAC etc). Hopefully a fix for
	bugs 354 and 357.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The CodecPrivate element for QuickTime video
	tracks like Sorenson Video Codecs contained wrong data. Fix for
	bug 355.

	* all: Added a Japanese translation by Hiroki Taniura (see
	AUTHORS).

2009-03-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed detection of little endian PCM tracks
	in MOV files. Fix for bug 356.

2009-03-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The charset for text output was not
	initialized correctly resulting in garbled display of non-ASCII
	characters in non-UTF-8 locales.

	* all: bug fix: A couple of translated strings were converted from
	the wrong locale when they were displayed.

	* mmg, mkvinfo: The GUIs now require an Unicode-enabled version of
	wxWidgets.

2009-03-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: bug fix: The tools use the API call "GetOEMCP()" on Windows
	instead of "GetACP()". This should make messages output in cmd.exe
	come out correctly for Windows versions for which cmd.exe uses a
	different code page than the rest (e.g. on German Windows).

2009-03-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: enhancement: If mkvinfo is started in GUI mode on
	Windows then the console that was started with it will be closed.

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Chapter names and tag elements were recoded to
	the wrong charset resulting in garbled output. Fix for bug 353.

2009-03-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.5.3.

2009-03-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract, mmg: bug fix: If the environment variables
	LANG, LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES contained a locale that was supported by
	the system but for which mkvtoolnix did not contain a translation
	(e.g. fr_FR, it_IT, en_AU) then the programs would abort with an
	error message. Fix for bug 338.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Appending raw AVC/ES files resulted in
	segmentation faults. Fix for bug 344.

2009-02-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: When mkvmerge was run with the --attachments
	option to copy only some of the attachments in a Matroska file
	then any attachment with an ID larger than the first skipped
	attachment ID was not copied into the new file. Fix for bug 346.

	* Released v2.5.2.

	* installer: bug fix: If the installer is run in silent mode
	(switch "/S") then it will not ask the user whether or not to
	place a shortcut on the desktop, and that shortcut will not be
	created. Fix for bug 345.

	* mmg: new feature: Added two buttons "enable all" and "disable
	all" to the list of attached files that enable / disable all
	attached files.

	* mmg: bug fix: The action "File" -> "New" did not clear the
	internal list of attached files resulting in unexpected behaviour
	if files with attachments where added afterwards.

	* mmg: bug fix: The button "remove all files" did not clear the
	list of attached files.

2009-02-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: new feature: Made mkvinfo's GUI translatable. Added a
	German translation for the GUI.

2009-02-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: On Linux wxWidgets 2.8.0 and newer uses the GTK combo boxes
	which suck. A lot. Therefore mmg uses wxBitmapComboBoxes for
	wxWidgets >= 2.8.0 on Linux and normal wxComboBoxes in all other
	cases. wxBitmapComboBoxes are still drawn by wxWidgets itself
	(just like wxComboBoxes before 2.8.0) and offer much better
	functionality. Fix for bug 339.

	* mkvmerge, mmg: bug fix: The MIME type autodetection for
	attachments was broken for paths with non-ASCII characters on
	non-UTF-8 encoded systems (mostly on Windows). Fix for bug 340.

	* source: various fixes for compilation with wxWidgets 2.9.

2009-02-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all programs: bug fix: The locale was not detected properly
	often resulting in the program aborting with the message that
	"the locale could not be set properly". Fix for bug 338.

2009-02-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.5.1.

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed the selection of the translation to use if
	the LC_MESSAGES environment variable has been set on Windows.

2009-02-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.5.0.

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed a crash during the check if files could be
	overwritten by the next mux. Possible fix for bugs 335 and 336.

2009-02-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvinfo, mkvextract, mmg: Made all those programs
	nearly completly translatable. Added a German translation for all
	four programs (only for the programs, not for the static
	documentation: man pages, the guide to mmg etc).

	* mkvmerge, mmg: new feature: Added options ('-m' /
	'--attachments' and its counterparts '-M' / '--no-attachments')
	to mkvmerge for selecting which attachments to copy and which to
	skip and the corresponding controls to mmg.

2009-02-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the detection of AAC files whose first
	AAC header does not start on the first byte of the file.

2009-01-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: It was possible to crash mmg by clicking onto the
	root element in the chapter editor.

2009-01-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: During timecode extraction mkvextract wrote
	large timecodes in scientific notation.

2009-01-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.4.2.

2009-01-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If subtitle files are appended to separate
	video files (e.g. two AVI and two SRT files) then the subtitle
	timecodes of the second and all following subtitle files were
	based on the last timecode in the first subtitle file instead of
	the last timecode in the first video file. Fix for bug 325.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Due to uninitialized variables mkvmerge would
	report OGM files as having arbitrary display dimensions. Fix for
	bug 326.

2009-01-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mmg: enhancement: Implemented MIME type detection for
	attachments with libmagic on Windows.

2009-01-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If a Matroska file containing attachments was
	used as an input file and splitting was enabled then the
	attachments were only written to the first output file. Now
	they're written to each output file. Partial fix for bug 324.

2008-12-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Decreased the time mkvmerge needs for
	parsing Quicktime/MP4 header fields.

2008-12-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The parser for the simple chapter
	format (CHAPTERxx=...) can now handle more than 100 chapters. Fix
	for bug 320.

	* mmg: bug fix: The commands "Save command line" and "Create
	option file" did not save mmg's current state but the state it was
	in when the command "Show command line" was last used or when mmg
	was started.

2008-12-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a crash (segfault) with MPEG-4 part 2
	video if "--engage native_mpeg4" is used. Fix for bug 318.

2008-12-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Windows installer: The installer cleans up leftovers from old
	installations during an upgrade. It doesn't write registry entries
	for an exe called "AppMainExe.exe" anymore. It asks whether or not
	the user wants a shortcut on the desktop. It does not install the
	document for base64tool anymore because base64tool itself isn't
	installed anymore either. Fixes for bugs 314, 315, 316 and 317.

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed a compilation problem with non-Unicode
	enabled wxWidgets. Fix for bug 313.

2008-12-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for reading the pixel
	aspect ratio from Theora video tracks.

2008-12-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.4.1.

	* Build system: bug fix: Configure does not use "uname -m" for the
	detection of the Boost libraries anymore but configure's "$target"
	environment variable. This fixes the Boost detection for cross
	compilation builds. Fix for bug 311. Patch by Dominik Mierzejewski
	(see AUTHORS).

2008-12-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: PCM audio tracks bigger than approximately 8
	GB were cut off after approximately 8 GB.

2008-12-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge recognizes SRT subtitle files with
	timecodes that contain spaces between the colons and the digits
	and timecodes whose numbers are not exactly two or three digits
	long.

2008-11-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: mmg processes window events much more often during
	muxing.

	* all: Updated the language code list from the offical ISO 639-2
	standard.

2008-11-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Split timecodes with more than three decimals were
	not allowed even though the docs say that they are. They are now,
	as mkvmerge supports such timecodes.

2008-11-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Changed the way mkvmerge calculates the
	timecodes when appending files. Should result in better
	audio/video synchronization.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for reading SRT and SSA/ASS
	subtitles from AVI files (fix for bug 64).

2008-11-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge's LZO compressor would segfault if
	mkvmerge was compiled against v2 of the LZO library and the v1 LZO
	headers were not present.

2008-10-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: SRT subtitle files are also handled correctly
	if the timecode lines do not have spaces around the arrow between
	the start and end timecodes.

2008-10-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Matroska elements with binary data were
	output as garbage in XML files.

2008-10-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.4.0.

	* mmg: bug fix: The chapter editor's function "save to Matroska
	file" was corrupting the target file in some cases. Fix for bug
	307.

2008-10-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge was only writing one reference block
	for real B frames. Patch by Daniel Glöckner. Fix for bug 306.

	* all: bug fix: The Windows uninstaller was not removing all start
	menu entries during uninstallation on Windows Vista. The installer
	now creates the start menu entries for all users instead of the
	current user only. Fix for bug 305.

2008-10-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The "language" drop down box contained some
	entries twice or more. Fix for bug 304.

2008-10-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Incorrect usage of the iconv library caused
	some conversions to omit the last character of each converted
	entry (e.g. for the conversion from Hebrew to UTF-8). Fix for bug
	302.

2008-09-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: mkvmerge will use the timecodes provided
	by the MPEG program stream source file for VC1 video tracks.

2008-09-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Reading EVOBs with multiple VC1 video tracks
	was broken (all packets where put into a single video track).

2008-09-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added support for handling SimpleBlocks
	for timecode extraction.

2008-09-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Reading raw (E)AC3 files bigger than 2 GB was
	broken.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for Dirac video tracks.

2008-09-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Improved the detection of MPEG-1/-2 and
	AVC/h.264 video tracks in MPEG program streams (VOBs/EVOBs).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed reading DTS audio tracks from MPEG
	program streams (VOBs/EVOBs).

2008-09-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: Added the extensions "evo", "evob" and "vob"
	to mmg's "add file" dialog.

2008-09-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for muxing VC1 video tracks
	read from MPEG program streams (EVOBs) or raw VC1 elementary
	streams (e.g. as produced by EVODemux).

2008-09-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for 7.1 channel EAC3
	files. Fix for bug 301.

2008-09-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Revision 3831 (the change to the "--delay"
	and "--sync" options) caused mkvmerge to no longer respect the
	delay caused by garbage at the beginning of MP3 and AC3 audio
	tracks in AVI files. The timecodes of such tracks are now delayed
	appropriately again. Fix for bug 300.

2008-09-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Unknown stream types in Ogg files
	(e.g. skeleton tracks) don't cause mkvmerge to abort
	anymore. They're simply ignored. Fix for bug 299.

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added support for extracting Theora
	video tracks into Ogg files. Fix for bug 298.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the frame type (key or non-key frame)
	detection for Theora tracks.

2008-09-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: all: On Unix/Linux rpath linker flags have been
	removed again (they were actually removed before the release of
	v2.3.0).

2008-09-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.3.0.

2008-09-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: improved the timecode calculation for MP3
	tracks read from MP4 files. Another part of the fix for bug 165.

2008-09-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge honors the timecode offsets of all
	streams in a MPEG program stream (e.g. VOB file) fixing
	audio/video desynchronization. Fix for bug 295.

2008-08-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Switched from the PCRE regular expression library to
	Boost's RegEx library.

2008-08-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: DTS-in-WAV handling (14 to 16 bit expansion)
	was flawed. Fix for bug 288.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for Vorbis in AVI (format
	tag 0x566f). Fix for bug 271.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for PCM tracks with
	floating point numbers (CodecID A_PCM/FLOAT/IEEE). Patch by
	Aurelien Jacobs (see AUTHORS).

2008-08-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The fix to the timecode handling for AVC
	tracks in MP4 files from 2008-04-16 caused certain other MP4 files
	to not be read correctly. The video tracks were found, but no
	frames were read. Fix for bug 294.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for Ogg Kate
	subtitles. Patch by ogg.k.ogg.k@googlemail.com.

2008-08-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mmg: The option "--delay" was removed. The option
	"--sync" now only modifies the timecodes of a given
	track. mkvmerge does not pad audio tracks with silence. "--sync"
	works with all track types now, but using a stretch factor other
	than 1 with audio tracks might not work too well during
	playback. mmg's inputs for "Delay" and "Stretch by" can be used
	with all track types. Fix for bug 287.

2008-08-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: mmg outputs a more informative error
	message for known but unsupported input file types (e.g. ASF, FLV,
	MPEG TS) instead of the cryptic "file identification failed".

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The VobSub reader would sometimes read too
	many bytes for a single SPU packet. Part of a fix for bug 245.

2008-05-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Using BZIP2 compression resulted in broken
	streams. Patch by Aurelien Jacobs (see AUTHORS).

2008-05-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Improved support for WAV files bigger
	than 4 GB which only contain a single DATA chunk and a wrong
	length field for this DATA chunk (e.g. eac3to creates such files).

2008-05-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Certain Matroska files with dis-continuous
	streams (e.g. subtitles) caused huge memory consumption. Fix for
	bug 281.

2008-04-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge will output a proper error message
	if it is called with ASF/WMV files instead of detecting other
	kinds of streams (e.g. AVC ES streams). Fix for bug 280.

2008-04-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed an assertion in the OGM reader occuring
	for OGM files with embedded chapters. Fix for bug 279.

	* mkvmerge: all: On Unix/Linux rpath linker flags are added for
	library paths given in LDFLAGS and configure's "--with-extra-libs"
	options.

2008-04-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed wrong timecodes for MP4 files that
	contain video tracks with B frames and edit lists. Fix for bug
	277. Patch by Damiano Galassi (see AUTHORS).

2008-04-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge will not strip leading spaces in
	SRT subtitles anymore.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Tuned the file type detection for MPEG ES
	streams. Fix for bug 265.

2008-04-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed writing to UNC paths on Windows. Fix
	for bug 275.

2008-03-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for skipping ID3 tags in
	AAC and AC3 files. Fix for bug 204.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for DTS-HD (both "master
	audio" and "high resolution").

2008-03-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.2.0.

2008-02-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for handling AC3 in WAV in
	ACM mode.

2008-02-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for reading AC3 from
	QuickTime/MP4 files. Fix for bug 254.

2008-02-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for handling AC3 in WAV in
	IEC 61937 compatible streams (aka SPDIF mode).

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for WAV files with multiple
	data chunks.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a cause for the error message "no data
	chunk found" by fixing the skipping of 'fmt ' chunks.

2008-02-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for AAC-in-AVI with CodecID
	0x706d as created by mencoder. Fix for bug 266.

2008-02-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Rewrote the OGM reader code. Another part of
	a fix for bug 267.

2007-12-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Rewrote the timecode application
	code. Additionally force the "previous cluster timecodes" that
	libmatroska uses to the current timecode. This seems to get rid of
	libmatroska's assertions about the local timecode being to
	small/big to fit into an int16. It also seems to get rid of some
	of mkvmerge's errors about the packet queue not being empty, and
	it fixes a couple of crashes with file splitting.

2007-12-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: OGM files with non-Theora video tracks caused
	mkvmerge to fail since 2.1.0, or the resulting file was
	unplayable. Fix for bug 267.

2007-10-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Accept other Theora header versions than
	3.2.0 as long as the major version is 3 and the minor 2. Fix for
	bug 262.

2007-09-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: MPEG PS reader: Fixed the resyncing mechanism
	during normal reads. Another fix for bug 259.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: MPEG PS reader: mkvmerge tries to resync to
	the next MPEG start code in case of error during stream
	detection. Fix for bug 259.

2007-08-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: SVQ1 video tracks read from QuickTime files are output
	as V_MS/VFW/FOURCC tracks and not as V_QUICKTIME tracks. Fix for
	bug 257.

2007-08-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* avilib: bug fix: Fixed a segmentation fault if reading the first
	part of an index failed but a second/other index part is
	present. Fix for bug 256.

2007-08-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: SRT files that contain coordinates in the
	timecode line are supported. The coordinates are discarded
	automatically (as S_TEXT/SRT doesn't support them), and a warning
	is shown.

	* Released v2.1.0.

2007-08-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Added support for reading MP2 audio
	tracks from OGM files. Patch by Mihail Zenkov (see AUTHORS).

2007-08-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: enhancement: Added support for extracting Dolby
	Digital Plus (EAC3) tracks.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: SPS and PPS NALUs are no longer removed from
	AVC/h.264 streams. Hopefully a fix for bug 231.

2007-07-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Fixed SSA/ASS detection for files
	produced by Aegis Sub which doesn't include a line with '[script
	info]' in the file.

2007-07-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: Added another option how mmg choses the
	directory if automatic output filename creation is on. Implements
	all suggestions as listed in bug 248.

2007-07-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: Moved the complete 'settings' tab to its own
	dialog accessible via the 'Settings' option in the 'File' menu.

2007-06-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a buton 'remove all' which removes all
	input files and tracks leaving all other options as they are. Fix
	for bug 248.

	* mmg: new feature: Added an option for setting the default output
	directory if the automatic setting of the output file name is
	turned on. Fix for bug 248.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: DTS code: Some tools (e.g. Surcode) can
	create DTS files which are padded with zero bytes after each DTS
	frame. These zero bytes are now skipped without printing a
	warning.

	* mmg: enhancement: mmg can now be called with any file name as an
	argument. If it ends with 'mmg' then the file will be loaded as a
	'mmg settings file'. Otherwise mmg will 'add' it. Fix for bug 243.

2007-06-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The OGM reader uses the OGM's timestamps for
	video tracks. Before it would just use the current frame number
	multiplied by the FPS.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: The OGM reader now uses the AVC/h.264
	video packetizer for AVC/h.264 tracks so that the aspect ratio can
	be extracted from it.

2007-06-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fixes: Fixed a couple of memory leaks.

2007-06-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added better checks if two tracks can be
	appended to the passthrough packetizer so that tracks that are
	otherwise not known to mkvmerge can still be appended
	(e.g. V_VC1). Fix for bug 244.

2007-06-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: The NALU size length can now be chosen for all AVC tracks,
	not only for those that are handled by the 'AVC ES packetizer'.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The 'default track' flag was set to 'yes' for
	tracks read from Matroska files even if 'no' was specified on the
	command line.

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added support for the 'header removal'
	encoding scheme.

2007-06-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: The NALU size length of an AVC/h.264
	track can now be changed even if the source is not an elementary
	stream (e.g. for MP4 and Matroska files).

2007-06-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Added support for RealAudio v3 in
	RealMedia files. Patch by Aurelian Jacobs. Fix for bug 246.

2007-06-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Moved the command line to a separate dialog and reduced the
	main window's height.

2007-04-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Another bug fix for handling various AC3 and
	E-AC3 files in MPEG program streams.

2007-04-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Added support for handling SEI NALUs in
	AVC/h.264 elementary streams so that "key frames" can be detected
	even if no IDR slices are present.

2007-04-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the VobSub reader so that "delay:"
	lines with negative timecodes are accepted. Fix for bug 241.

2007-04-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Improved the file type detection code for
	MPEG transport streams.

2007-03-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a problem reading normal AC3 tracks
	from MPEG program streams.

2007-03-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed an issue with negative/huge timecodes
	after splitting AVC/h.264 video.

2007-03-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: The SRT reader allows "." as the decimal
	separator as well as ",".

2007-03-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a problem with concatenating more than
	two subtitle files.

2007-03-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: The MPEG program stream reader will now sort the
	tracks it finds first by their type (video > audio > subs) and
	then by their stream ID.

	* mkvmerge: Disabled the support for DTS tracks in MPEG program
	streams because DTS HD is not supported yet.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Implemented a major speed-up for reading
	MPEG-1/2 and AVC/h.264 tracks from MPEG program streams.

2007-03-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Fixed the MPEG PS reader so that it will
	just skip blocks whose headers it cannot parse instead of
	aborting.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for handling AVC/h.264
	tracks in MPEG program streams.

2007-03-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for EAC3 tracks in MPEG
	program streams.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for EAC3/DD+ (Dolby Digital
	Plus) files and tracks (raw EAC3 files or inside Matroska with
	CodecID A_EAC3).

2007-02-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.0.2.

2007-02-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Reintroduced the "--engage allow_avc_in_vfw_mode"
	hack.

2007-02-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed suppoert for DTS-in-WAV files which
	are encoded with 14 bits per word.

2007-02-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Added support for DTS files which use
	only 14 out of every 16 bits and which are not stored inside a WAV
	file.

2007-01-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mmg: Changed the default for the "NALU size length" to
	"4" and added a warning if "3" is used.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: File type detection for Qt/MP4 files which
	start with a "wide" atom has been fixed.

	* mmg: bug fix: The "NALU size length" drop down box is now also
	enabled for h.264 tracks read from AVIs and for h.264 tracks
	stored in "VfW compatibility mode" in Matroska files.

2007-01-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mmg: new feature: Extended the option
	"--default-track" so that it can be forced to "off" allowing the
	user to create a file for which no track has its "default" flag
	set. Fix for bug #224.

2007-01-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the wrong "default duration" if the
	user used "--default-duration ...23.976fps".

2007-01-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The AVC/h.264 ES reader was losing frames if
	the file size was an exact multiple of 1048576 bytes.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The AVC/h.264 ES packetizer produced invalid
	CodecPrivate data if the AVCC did not contain the aspect ratio
	information. Fix for Bugzilla bug #225.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Matroska reader passes the correct track
	number down to the AVC/h.264 ES packetizer in the case of "AVC
	in Matroska stored in VfW mode".

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a crash (segmentation fault) in the
	AVC/h.264 ES handling code.

2007-01-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract, mkvinfo: new feature: Added support for
	using CodecState for signaling changes to CodecPrivate. It is used
	for MPEG-1/-2 video if it is turned on with "--engage
	use_codec_state".

2007-01-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v2.0.0.

2007-01-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added another tab for each track in which the
	user can add arbitrary track options.

	* mkvextract: enhancement: mkvextract will now also print which
	container format it uses for each track.

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added support for extracting MPEG-1/2
	video to MPEG-1/2 program streams.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the file type detection for MPEG-1/2 ES
	files with a single frame inside.

2007-01-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: MPEG-1/2 video: The sequence and GOP headers
	are not removed from the bitstream anymore. This should fix the
	blockiness if the sequence headers change mid-stream. Fix for
	Bugzilla bug #167.

2007-01-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: mkvmerge now handles the first frames in
	AVC/h.264 ES streams properly, especially for files for which it
	did not find a key frame at the beginning in earlier versions.

2007-01-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Improved the detection of AVC/h.264 ES
	streams with garbage at the beginning.

	* mmg: enhancements to the job management dialog: There's a
	minimum width for the columns. The "up" and "down" buttons are
	disabled if all entries are selected. Pressing "Ctrl-A" selects
	all entries.

	* mmg: enhancements: "File -> New" will also focus the "input"
	tab.

2007-01-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancements: The job manager can be opened with
	"Ctrl-J". The last directory from which a file is added is saved
	even if the file identification failed. The automatically
	generated output file name uses the extension ".mka" if no video
	track is found and ".mks" if neither a video nor an audio track is
	found in the first file.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the aspect ratio extraction for raw
	AVC/h.264 ES tracks.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If a raw AVC/h.264 ES file does not start
	with a key frame then all the frames before the first key frame
	are skipped, and mkvmerge does not abort anymore.

2007-01-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: AVC/h.264 ES parser: Fixed wrong NALU size
	length information in the AVCC.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: AVC/h.264 ES parser: Fixed the decision if a
	NALU belongs to a previous frame or starts a new one.

2007-01-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: Added an input for the new "NALU size length"
	parameter.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The NALU size length can be overridden for
	AVC/h.264 elementary streams. It defaults to 2 which might not be
	enough for larger frames/slices.

2007-01-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Support for AVC/h.264 elementary streams with
	short markers (0x00 0x00 0x01 instead of 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x01).

	* mkvmerge: Removed the "--engage allow_avc_in_vfw_mode" hack.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Added "x264" to the list of recognized
	FourCCs for AVC/h.264 video in AVI and Matroska files.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for proper muxing of
	AVC/h.264 tracks in Matroska files that were stored in the MS
	compatibility mode (CodecID V_MS/VFW/FOURCC instead of
	V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed invalid memory access in the AVC ES
	parser.

2007-01-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for proper muxing of
	AVC/h.264 tracks in AVI files.

2007-01-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for reading AVC/h.264
	elementary streams.

2006-12-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: All inputs and controls are cleared and
	deactivated if the user select "File -> New".

	* mmg: enhancement: The user can switch between the "generic" and
	"format specific options" pages even if no track is selected.

2006-12-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge would not write frame durations if
	"--engage use_simpleblock" was used resulting in unplayable and
	unextractable subtitle tracks.

2006-12-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Added a workaround for RealAudio tracks for
	which the key frame flag is never set.

2006-12-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed a segfault that occured if the user had a
	track selected and its the file the track was read from is
	removed.

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed the behaviour of a couple of ComboBoxes on
	Windows after selecting "File -> New". E.g. if the user selected
	"700M" in the "split after this size" ComboBox, selected "File ->
	New" and selected "700M" again, then it would not show up in the
	command line window until he selected another option and returned
	to the "700M" afterwards.

2006-11-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.8.1.

2006-11-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Some input controls (like "subtitle charset")
	where disabled for appended tracks even though the user can and
	sometimes has to change those settings. Fixes Anthill bug 216.

2006-11-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* configure: new feature: Allow the user to tell configure which
	"wx-config" executable to use ("--with-wx-config=...").

2006-11-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The "aspect ratio" box was losing its input when
	the user switched tracks.

	* mkvmerge/mmg: new feature: If ATDS AAC tracks are added to mmg
	and the AAC track's sample rate is <= 24000 Hz then mkvmerge and
	mmg assume that the AAC is a SBR track and mmg will check the "AAC
	is SBR" checkbox automatically.

2006-11-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Quicktime/MP4 files with AVC video tracks and
	missing CTTS atoms caused mkvmerge to crash after the recent
	changes to the Quicktime/MP4 timecode handling.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a segfault if the file specified with
	"--attach-file" does not exist. Bugfix for Anthill bug 213 and
	Debian bug 393984.

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed a crash on loading XML chapters after having
	saved XML chapters.

2006-11-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Made the "set the delay input field from the
	file name" feature disengageable.

2006-11-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.8.0.

	* mkvmerge: Changed the CodecID for AAC audio tracks to "A_AAC" by
	default. The CodecPrivate contains the same initialization data
	that are stored in the ESDS in MP4 files for AAC tracks. The old
	CodecIDs (e.g. "A_AAC/MPEG4/SBR") can be turned on again with
	"--engage old_aac_codecid".

2006-11-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Reworked the "input tab" and split track options into two
	sub-pages. Also added an input for the "stereo mode" parameter for
	video tracks.

2006-11-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for the "stereo mode"
	flag for video tracks.

2006-11-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: For MP4 files with certain CTTS contents
	mkvmerge would use negative timecodes for a couple of
	frames. Those frames were dropped and mkvmerge often ended up
	eating huge amounts of memory and crashing afterwards.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: AAC-in-MP4 with the LC profile was sometimes
	misdetected as having a SBR extension and an output sampling
	frequency of 96000 Hz. Fixes Anthill bug 210.

2006-10-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added support for API changes in the upcoming FLAC
	library v1.1.3. Patch by Josh Coalson (see AUTHORS).

2006-09-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the random number generation on
	Windows. On Windows 9x/ME mkvmerge would simply hang. On newer
	versions the function was accessing invalid memory and was
	generally buggy.

2006-09-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: SSA/ASS subtitles with comments before the
	"[script info]" line were not identified.

2006-09-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Made the checks for SRT timecodes a bit less
	strict (e.g. allow fewer than three digits after the comma).

2006-07-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Comments in OGM files were not handled if
	mkvmerge was called in identification mode. One obvious result was
	that neither the track language nor the file title was imported
	into mmg.

2006-06-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The "stretch" input box was not accepting the same
	syntax that mkvmerge's "--sync" parameter accepts.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: PCM audio data with 4 bits per Sample caused
	mkvmerge to allocate all available memory. Patch by Robert Millan
	(see AUTHORS).

2006-06-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Mixed up two tool tips on the "settings" tab.

2006-06-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Build system: bug fix: Moved some @...@ style variables from
	configure.in to Makefile.in where they belong (very recent
	autoconf versions were choking on those).

2006-06-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added an option for always using simple
	blocks.

	* mmg: new feature: Pre-set the "delay" input field for audio
	tracks if the file name contains something like "DELAY XX" where
	XX is a number.

2006-05-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enchancement: After adding files with drag&drop the next
	"open file" dialog will start in the directory the last file came
	from.

2006-05-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge will no longer create empty files
	(meaning neither input files nor things like chapters etc have
	been added).

2006-04-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.7.0.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Added support for MIME type detection via
	libmagic (patch by Robert Millan with heavy modifications by
	myself).

2006-04-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Theora headers were not handled correctly.

2006-04-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The WavPack reader was broken on 64bit
	systems (e.g. AMD64).

2006-03-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Theora timecode handling was broken, and
	Ogg/Theora files were not identified correctly (they showed up as
	"unknown" in mmg).

2006-02-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: The 'adjust timecodes' function accepts
	timecodes like 'XXXXXunit' with 'unit' being 'ms', 'us', 'ns' or
	's'.

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: mkvmerge will no longer refuse to
	concatenate files with differing Codec Private contents and only
	issue a warning in such cases.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Quicktime/MP4 reader: Added support for
	version 1 media headers ('mdhd' atom) with 64bit fields. Fixed the
	duration of the last packet passed downstream. Fixed overflow
	issues during re-scaling from the Quicktime/MP4's time scale to
	nano seconds used by mkvmerge.

2006-01-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Muxing wasn't working Windows 9x/ME because
	mkvmerge was trying to use Unicode file access functions when
	determining which directories to create. Fixes Anthill bug #177.

2006-01-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for the "Delay:" feature
	and for negative timecodes in VobSub IDX files.

2005-12-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: If mmg is set to automatically fill in the
	output file name then it will clear the output file name once all
	input files have been removed.

2005-12-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed a crash that occured if the user removed an
	attachment and clicked somewhere in the empty space in the
	attachment list. Occured only on Windows.

2005-12-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Re-added Chinese to the list of popular languages
	(those are listed first in the language drop down boxes).

2005-12-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The last change to the ISO 639 language
	handling broke the VobSub reader so that it reported the wrong
	language codes. This also caused mmg to not display the correct
	language after adding a VobSub file.

2005-12-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.6.5.

2005-12-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* source: bug fix: Changed the list of ISO 639 languages so that
	the terminology versions are converted into the bibliography
	versions of the 639-2 codes (e.g. use "ger" instead of "deu" for
	the German language). Converted almost all pieces of mkvmerge and
	mmg to accept ISO 639-1, 639-2 codes (both bibliography and
	terminology versions) and the languages' English names. Those will
	always be converted to the 639-2 code. Fixes Anthill bug #171.

2005-12-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The country code used in XML chapter files
	was checked against the list of ISO 639-1 codes and not against
	the list of ccTLDs. Partial bugfix for Anthill bug #171.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: When appending tracks and using timecodes the
	timecodes were only used for the first track in a chain of
	tracks. This has been changed so that you must specify only one
	timecode file in such cases (e.g. "mkvmerge ... --timecodes
	0:my_timecodes.txt part1.avi +part2.avi"). mmg has already been
	working like this. Fixes Anthill bug #162.

2005-12-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* source: new feature: Added support for linking against liblzo2
	(same compression algorithm, just a new library version). Patch by
	Diego Pettenò (see AUTHORS).

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added a workaround for files created by
	Gabest's DirectShow Matroska muxer with slightly broken frame
	references. Fixes Anthill bug #172.

	* mkvextract: new feature: attachment extraction mode: Made the
	output file name optional. If it is missing (e.g. "mkvextract
	attachments source.mkv 92385: 124981:") then the name of the
	attachment inside the Matroska file is chosen instead. Patch by
	Sergey Hakobyan (see AUTHORS).

	* mkvmerge: new feature: If an output file name contains
	directories that don't exist then they're created. Patch by Sergey
	Hakobyan (see AUTHORS) with modifications by myself.

2005-11-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Don't abort reading a Matroska if the next
	element is not a cluster. This is the case for e.g. files produced
	by Haali's muxer which writes the segment tracks element in
	intervals. Fixes Anthill bug #169.

2005-11-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed a problem with the selection of language
	codes for chapters in the chapter editor.

2005-11-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If at least or more attachments were present
	and the user used --attachment-name for each of them (as mmg does)
	then mkvmerge was wrongly outputting a warning about multiple uses
	of --attachment-name for a single attachment.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added limited support for edit lists in
	MP4/QuickTime files. Fixes Anthill bug #151.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: MP4/QuickTime files which contain another
	atom before the 'avcC' atom in the video track headers weren't
	correctly remuxed.

2005-11-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge will now refuse to append AVC/h.264
	video tracks whose codec initialization data blocks do not
	match. Invalidates Anthill bug #163.

2005-11-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a crash If the granulepos (the
	timecodes) reset in the middle of an Ogg/OGM file. Fixes Anthill
	bug #166.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a division-by-zero error in the
	RealMedia demuxer. Fixes Anthill bug #161.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a couple of potential (and actual)
	segmentation faults by accessing invalid memory addresses. Initial
	patch for the VobSub reader by Issa on Doom9's forum.

2005-11-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mmg: new feature: The names of attached files can be
	set with a new option --attachment-name or on mmg's "Attachments"
	page.

2005-11-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed another bug when appending AVC/h.264
	tracks that would mkvmerge cause to die with "bref_packet ==
	NULL". Fixes Anthill bug #160.

2005-11-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: When the user saved the muxing output in a log
	file that file didn't use Windows line endings (CR LF) on
	Windows.

	* mmg: bug fix: Appending tracks was broken because the track
	numbers in the command line were incorrect. Fixes Anthill bug
	#160.

2005-10-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for Ogg/Theora.

2005-10-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changed the CodecID for AAC audio tracks to "A_AAC" by
	default The CodecPrivate contains the same initialization data
	that are stored in the ESDS in MP4 files for AAC tracks. The old
	CodecIDs (e.g. "A_AAC/MPEG4/SBR") can be turned on again with
	"--engage old_aac_codecid".

2005-10-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: new feature: The sub elements of the EBML head are
	now shown.

	* mkvinfo: new feature: Added support for the new SimpleBlock.

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added support for the new SimpleBlock.

	* mkvmerge, mmg: new feature: Added support for the new
	SimpleBlock instead of BlockGroups (only available via "--engage
	use_simpleblock" for now). Patch by Steve Lhomme (see AUTHORS)
	with fixes by myself.

2005-10-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.6.0.

2005-10-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Implemented the new header removal
	compression: compression for native MPEG-4 part 2, decompression
	for all types (don't use it yet, folks!).

2005-10-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Extra codec data wasn't written to AVI
	files if it was present (e.g. for the HuffYuv codec). Fixes bug
	157.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge was choking on AVIs with a single
	frame inside. Fixes bug 156.

2005-09-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Changed how AVC video frames are
	referenced. This is not ideal yet, but at least references are
	kept intact when reading AVC from Matroska files. Should fix bug
	154.

2005-09-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Appending AVC video tracks was broken if they
	contained aspect ratio information that the user overwrote on the
	command line.

	* mmg: bug fix: If a video track was selected that was appended to
	another track then the aspect ratio drop down box was still
	active.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: MPEG-4 part 2 streams are searched for
	the pixel width/height values. Those are taken if they differ from
	those values in the source container. This is a work-around for
	buggy muxers, e.g. broken video camera firmwares writing bad MP4
	files. Fixes bug 149.

2005-09-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Appending files with RealVideo was
	broken.

2005-09-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract: bug fix: ASS files sometimes use a column
	called 'Actor' instead of 'Name', but both should be mapped to the
	'name' column in a Matroska file.

2005-09-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.5.6.

2005-09-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: If the user selected an aspect ratio for a video
	track, then chose "File -> new", added a file, selected another
	video track and chose the same aspect ratio as before then it
	wasn't added to the command line. Fixes Anthill bugs 132 and 146.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Support Qt/MP4 files with 64bit offset tables
	('co64' atom instead of 'stco' atom).

2005-09-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: mkvmerge will remove the aspect ratio
	information from a AVC/h.264 video track bitstream and put it into
	the display dimensions (until now the AR information was kept on
	the bitstream level). The reason is that in Matroska the container
	AR is supposed to take precedence over bitstream AR, but some
	decoder programmers ignore the container AR in favour of bitstream
	AR.

2005-08-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: The GUI couldn't open files with non-ASCII
	chars in the file name.

2005-08-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Display dimensions were reported for all
	tracks, even if they weren't present. In that case they allegedly
	were "0x0" which caused mmg to add "--display-dimensions ...:0x0"
	for each track read from a Matroska file, even if the tracks were
	not video tracks.

2005-08-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The extracted timecodes were wrong for
	blocks with laced frames.

2005-08-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If a Matroska file with a MPEG-4 part 2 video
	track was muxed into a Matroska file and the source file did not
	contain the display width/height elements for that track then the
	aspect ratio was extracted from the video data itself which
	clashes with the Matroska specs which say that display
	width/height default to the pixel width/height if they're not
	present.

2005-08-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Native MPEG-4 ASP storage was still bugged:
	timecodes were assigned twice, frames referenced themselves.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Embedded fonts and pictures in a SSA/ASS file
	are not discarded any longer. They are converted to Matroska
	attachments instead. Other sections that were discarded are added
	to the CodecPrivate data as are "Comment:" lines in the "[Events]"
	section. Those comment lines still lose their association for
	which "Dialogue:" line they were meant, but that cannot be
	changed.

2005-08-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: --delay was not working at all.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Single digit numbers followed by 's' were not
	recognized as valid numbers with a unit (e.g. in '--delay 0:9s').

	* Released v1.5.5.

	* mkvtoolnix: Disabled storing AVC/h.264 video tracks in VfW mode.

2005-08-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvtoolnix: bug fix: On Windows the command line output was
	terminated with CR CR NL instead of just CR NL.

2005-08-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Quicktime/MP4 reader wasn't skipping
	unknown elements correctly.

2005-08-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added a new extraction mode for
	outputting timecodes in a timecode v2 format file. It is called
	"timecode_v2" and takes the same arguments as the "tracks"
	extraction mode.

	* mkvinfo: new feature: Added a command line switch
	"--output-charset" which sets the charset that strings read from
	Matroska files are output in (e.g. if you want the output in UTF-8
	and not your system's local charset).

	* mkvinfo: new feature: Added a command line switch "-o" for
	redirecting the output to a file (for systems which re-interpret
	stdout).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The combination of using external timecode
	files and video tracks with B frames was not working as
	intended. The user had to order the timecodes in the timecode file
	just like the frames were ordered (meaning the timecodes for a
	IPBBP sequence with 25 FPS had to be "0", "120", "40,
	"80"...). This has been fixed. They have to be ascending again and
	mkvmerge will assign them properly.

2005-08-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added support for extracting h.264 /
	AVC tracks into proper h.264 ES streams supported by
	e.g. MP4Box. Patch by Matt Rice (see AUTHORS).

2005-07-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Files with non-ASCII chars weren't opened
	because conversion to UTF-8 was done before the charset routines
	were initialized.

2005-07-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a crash if a track in a MP4/QuickTime
	file did not contain a STCO atom (chunk table) but a STSC atom
	(chunk map table).

2005-07-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Very large values were not kept correctly for
	a lot of elements (meaning they were truncated to 16 or 32 bits).

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Very large values were not displayed correctly
	for a lot of elements (meaning they were truncated to 16 or 32
	bits prior to displaying).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: AVC/H.264 references were wrong, and muxing
	of AVC from Matroska files with proper references resulted in
	unplayable files.

2005-07-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed support for USF subtitles stored in
	UTF-16 and UTF-32. Added support for USF subtitles stored in UTF-8
	without a BOM.

2005-07-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.5.0.

2005-06-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The track language read from old Matroska
	files was wrongfully set to "und" if it was not written although
	the specs say that "eng" is the default value.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: USF subtitles: If identical tags were nested
	(e.g. "font") and both were closed right after each other then the
	result looked like "</font/>".

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Native MPEG-4 was not working if read from
	OGM files.

2005-06-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added an input box for mkvmerge's new "split
	after these timecodes" feature.

2005-06-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fixes: Improved the native MPEG-4 generation a lot
	(thanks to Haali for testing and pushing me). The codec version
	string inside the MPEG-4 initialization data is now checked if it
	indicates "DivX packed bitstream" and changed to not indicate it
	anymore.

2005-06-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: If mmg was minimized when it was closed (e.g. with
	Windows' "Show desktop" function) then it didn't show up after a
	restart and could only be shown by maximizing it.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If a OGM style chapter file contains empty
	chapter names ('CHAPTER01NAME=' without something after the '=')
	then this chapter's timecode is used as the name instead of
	aborting.

2005-06-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added splitting after specific
	timecodes.

2005-06-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvinfo, mkvextract: bug fix: Inifite sized segments
	were not handled correctly.

2005-05-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: On Windows mmg could be crashed by adding a file
	and clicking into the empty space in the "track" selection
	box. Fixes Anthill bug 133.

	* mkvextract: new feature: Implemented the extraction of USF
	subtitles.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Implemented the muxing of USF subtitles.

2005-05-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The MPEG packets are now padded to 2048
	byte boundaries as some programs require them to be. Patch by
	Mike Matsnev (see AUTHORS).

2005-05-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Removed the restriction of max. ten levels of
	nested elements.

	* mmg: bug fix: If splitting was enabled and "splitting by time"
	selected and the user chose "new" from the "File" menu then
	"splitting by time" was not selectable anymore. This happened
	only on Windows. Fixes Anthill bug 131.

2005-05-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Use the native newline style when
	extracting text subtitles (\r\n on Windows and \n on all other
	systems).

	* mkvextract: bug fix: SSA/ASS text was missing in the output if
	the "Format=" line contained newlines at the end of the
	CodecPrivate data (e.g. our old Mew Mew sample file).

2005-05-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for the ChapterSegmentUID
	element.

2005-04-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Support WAV files that use other RIFF chunks
	than the usual "fmt " followed by "data".

2005-04-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Remuxing MPEG1/2 tracks resulted in a failing
	"assert(0)".

2005-04-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.4.2.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: In rare occasions involving B frames mkvmerge
	freed data too early. In such a case it was eating more and more
	memory finally exiting with a message about not finding a packet
	for a "bref".

2005-04-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: bug fix: My output functions did not work on AMD64
	systems. Fixes Anthill bug 120.

2005-04-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added the extraction of the raw
	data with the "--raw" and "--fullraw" flags. Patch by Steve Lhomme
	(see AUTHORS).

	* mkvextract: bug fix: WAVPACK extraction did not update the
	"number of samples" header field. Patch by Steve Lhomme (see
	AUTHORS).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: RealMedia files contain a "FPS" field in
	their track headers. Unfortunately this field does not always
	contain the actual FPS of a video track but the maximum number of
	FPS that the encoder has output or should output. Therefore
	mkvmerge does not use a "default duration" element for RealVideo
	tracks anymore. Fixes Anthill bug 113.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Failing calls to posix_fadvise upon adding a
	file to mmg caused mmg to think that the file identification
	failed. Now warnings for posix_fadvise are not output anymore, and
	posix_fadvise is silently switched off for that file. Fixes
	Anthill bug 123.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Appending files that were created with
	mkvmerge's "--link" option was broken. The timecodes for both the
	chapters and the actual media data blocks were not adjusted
	correctly. Fixes Anthill bugs 115 and 116.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If chapters are present in several appended
	files and there were atoms who shared the same UID then those
	entries were present multiple times in the output files. Now such
	entries are merged into one chapter entry. Fixes the second part
	of Anthill bug 122.

2005-04-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If chapters were present and splitting was
	enabled then mkvmerge would not treat chapters correctly that
	spanned across several files. Now the spanning chapters are kept
	in all files, and their start timecodes are adjusted accordingly.
	Fixes the first part of Anthill bug 122.

2005-03-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: On Windows mkvinfo was linked without the
	console subsystem resulting in no output at all if run without the
	GUI (-g). Fixes Anthill Bug 118.

2005-03-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Due to the compiler doing some strange number
	conversion mkvextract seemed to hang on Windows with certain
	files.

2005-03-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Appending VobSubs with more than one track in
	a .idx file and video files at the same time was broken resulting
	in parts of some of the VobSub tracks not ending up in the
	resulting Matroska file. Fixes Anthill bug 114.

2005-03-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The track numbers were assigned wrongly when
	appending tracks (this is more or less cosmetic).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Splitting by time was broken for audio-only
	files. Fixes Anthill bug 112.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The --fourcc switch was not working.

2005-03-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Tracks that were not selected on saving the
	settings file were selected after loading a settings file.

2005-03-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.4.1.

2005-03-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: AC3 detection was broken in rare cases.

2005-03-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: If the TEMP environment variable contains spaces
	then the calls to mkvmerge when adding files failed.

2005-03-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Extracting the FPS from some AVC MP4 files
	did not work.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Appending + splitting was segfaulting if used
	together and at least one split occured after a track has been
	appended.

2005-03-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added more descriptive error messages if two tracks
	cannot be concatenated because "their parameters do not match".

2005-02-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: A failing call to posix_fadvise will only
	turn its usage off for that one file and not abort mkvmerge
	completely.

	* mmg: bug fix: When "appending" a file all tracks where added to
	the end of the track list making it unnecessarily difficult to
	concatenate similar structured files. Now the tracks from the
	"appended" files are inserted into the track list after their
	counterparts from the file this new one is appended to.

2005-02-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: An "appended" file could not be removed if there
	were two tracks that we not separated by a track from another file
	in the track list box.

	* mmg: bug fix: The check whether or not a file might be
	overwritten while splitting is active has been fixed.

	* mmg: bug fix: Improved the word wrapping of the tooltips on
	Windows.

	* mmg: bug fix: It was possible to select a file for appending
	even though no file was added first.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge was wrongly outputting large numbers
	of warnings when Remuxing AVC/h.264 video from a Matroska file.

	* mmg: bug fix: The job queue was not loaded on startup on Windows
	Unicode builds (another wxWidgets 2.5.3 problem).

2005-02-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The job status in the job runner dialog was broken
	on Unicode builds on all systems.

	* mmg: bug fix: "Splitting by time" was not selectable on Windows
	Unicode builds (problem with wxWidgets 2.5.3).

	* mmg: bug fix: mkvmerge's output during muxing was not converted
	from UTF-8.

	* mmg: bug fix: The default extension added when the user doesn't
	give one is different in wxWidgets 2.4.x and 2.5.x. It should
	always be .mkv and not .mka.

	* Released v1.4.0.

2005-02-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: The "default track" checkboxes are set
	properly when a Matroska file is added.

	* mmg: new feature: Added a warning right before the muxing starts
	if the chapter editor contains entries but no chapter file has
	been selected (can be turned off).

2005-02-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added VobSub extraction based on Mike
	Matsnev's code.

2005-02-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Track names could not be set to be empty.

2005-02-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.0.2.

2005-02-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Use the posix_fadvise function on *nix
	systems. This results in a considerable speed up for the whole
	muxing process. As the function call seems to be buggy on at least
	Linux kernels 2.4.x it can be disabled completely during
	configure. It will only be used on Linux with a kernel from the
	2.6.x series or newer.

2005-02-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Empty video frames in AVIs right at the
	beginning were breaking the MPEG-4 aspect ratio extraction and
	caused problems in other parts, too.

2005-01-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: It was possible to create chapter entries with
	invalid or even empty language entries. Not only are those
	invalid, such XML files can also not be loaded by mmg.

	* mmg: bug fix: Overwriting a chapter file did not erase the
	previous file. So if the previous file was bigger than the current
	chapters then garbage remained at the end of the file.

2005-01-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge did not accept XML chapter files
	created with older mkvtoolnix versions due to deprecated chapter
	elements. Such elements are now skipped.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added some more possible formats for
	binary data in XML files besides Base64 encoded data: hex encoded
	and ASCII "encoded".

2005-01-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The "stretch" input box tooltip was wrong. The
	resulting command line was broken, too.

2005-01-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Hex values accept more formats (like
	optional white space between numbers or the "0x" prefix).

2005-01-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changed the AVC/h.264 timecode handling to include the
	timecode offsets from the CTTS atom.

2005-01-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Reformatted the HTML guide and updated the screenshots. It
	should be more readable for those whose desktop is not 1200 pixels
	wide.

2005-01-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Made the mkvmerge GUI guide available by
	pressing F1 or selecting "Help" from the "Help" menu.

2005-01-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: ASS/SSA extraction was broken in some rare
	cases.

2005-01-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added support for mkvmerge's new "appending
	tracks" feature.

2004-12-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for reading the pixel
	aspect ratio from AVC/h264 video data.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added AVC/h264 muxing from MP4.

2004-12-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added a MPEG PS demuxer.

	* mkvinfo: new feature: Added a couple new elements (silent
	tracks). Patch by Steve Lhomme (see AUTHORS).

2004-12-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added WAVPACK4 extraction. Patch by
	Steve Lhomme (see AUTHORS).

2004-12-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added WAVPACK4 muxing. Patch by Steve
	Lhomme (see AUTHORS).

	* mmg: bug fix: Again the window handling. Hopefully this is
	better than the other attempts.

2004-12-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added VobButton muxing. Patch by Steve
	Lhomme (see AUTHORS).

2004-12-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: One was able to crash mmg by pressing 'ok' in the
	muxing dialog right after muxing finished, especially if the
	'abort' button was hit before. This mostly happened on Linux.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed negative audio displacement for a
	couple of formats.

2004-12-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.0.1.

2004-12-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Fixed some layout issues with wxWidgets 2.5.3 and newer.

2004-12-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: The window position is saved and restored when
	mmg is started the next time.

2004-12-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed a crash/memory corruption showing weird
	characters in the input boxes. This happened when the user removed
	a file from mmg while mmg was updating the command line.

	* mmg: bug fix: mmg now has an icon associated with it while it is
	running instead of the generic Windows application icon (Windows
	only).

	* mmg: bug fix: The main window is now minimized during
	muxing. This allows to hide both of the windows while muxing is
	running and restoring them later, even if they were iconized when
	muxing finished (Windows only).

2004-11-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The first packet of an AAC track read from
	Real containers might not start at the timecode 0. This offset was
	ignored by mkvmerge.

2004-11-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Made the muxing dialog ("mkvmerge is running")
	modal all the time. This prevents the user from hitting the main
	window's minimize button. On Windows this makes mmg stuck in
	iconized mode if it was iconized when muxing finished.

2004-11-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a buffer overflow in the UTF-8 file
	reading routines.

2004-11-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Implemented concatenating files with chapters.

	* mkvmerge: Changed the "progress" output. It's now correct for
	file concatenation, too.

2004-11-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v1.0.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Concatenating/appending files is now
	possible. A lot of things aren't tested, and others simply don't
	work yet (chapter merging, duplicate tag elimination, proper
	progress report, support in mmg just to name a few), but the basic
	functionality seems to work.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Matroska reader doesn't insist on having
	a default duration ( = FPS) for video tracks in the "AVI
	compatibility mode" ( = with the CodecID "V_MS/VFW/FOURCC"). This
	enables re-muxing of Matroska files created from MP4 files.

2004-11-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: File names with non-ASCII characters were not
	working if mmg was compiled against a Unicode enabled wxWidgets.

2004-11-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added reading DTS from AVIs and from
	Matroska files.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: A variable initialization was missing which
	very recent gcc versions (3.4.2) did not like very much. Also
	fixed a small compilation bug.

2004-10-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The handling of external timecode files was
	still not correct but should be OK now.

2004-10-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Added an error message if the user selects 'mmg' as the
	'mkvmerge executable' because that would lead to an infinite
	number of 'mmg's being spawned.

2004-10-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If LFE is on for DTS then the number of
	channels is one more than what the DTS frame header says.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Timecodes for Vorbis were wrong on rare
	occasions (when reading laced Vorbis from a Matroska file and
	changing the lacing, e.g. when splitting for the second and all
	following files).

2004-10-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge/mkvinfo/mkvextract: bug fix: The chapter and tag
	element tables were not always intialized correctly depending on
	the compiler and the optimization flags used.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The OGM reader was broken if at least one
	track was not to be copied from the file (happened between 0.9.5
	and 0.9.6).

	* mmg: bug fix: After loading saved mmg settings the track input
	box listed the tracks always coming from the last input file and
	not from the one they really came from.

2004-10-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: enhancement: Made mmg's main window properly resizable.

	* mkvmerge: Rewrote the code for the external timecode files. This
	also fixes bug 99: The durations for the individual tracks were
	not correct for those tracks for which --timecodes was used.

2004-10-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Crash when saving chapters from the chapter
	editor. Same as the mkvinfo issue below but on all OS.

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: The chapter and tag element tables were not
	initialized on Windows resulting in a crash when one of those
	elements was encountered.

2004-10-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.9.6.

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The track extraction was creating the
	output file twice if the Matroska file contained a copy of the
	track headers. This resulted in the first extracted file being
	overwritten at the end of extraction.

	* mmg: bug fix: If the file title is read from an input file, not
	modified by the user and that input file is removed again then the
	file title will be unset.

2004-10-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: enhancement: Converted the raw FLAC reader to use
	another interface to the FLAC libraries. This results in a speedup
	of up to 50%. Thanks to Josh Coalson for telling me about its
	existence.

2004-10-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added two warnings. One about invalid
	track IDs that were used on the command line but that don't
	correspond to an available track in a file and one if no track
	will be copied from a source file. Both warnings hint at bad
	command line arguments.

2004-10-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Only write the segment duration as a 64bit float if
	there is no video track present. This way users won't have to
	update their DirectShow filter/apps for most files. Only
	audio-only files need this precision anyway.

	* mkvmerge: Changed the Ogg/OGM reader to use the stream number
	and not its serial number as the track ID (meaning the track IDs
	will be 0, 1, 2... etc. instead of the random numbers oggenc uses
	as the serial numbers).

2004-09-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: The CUE sheet parser now accepts INDEX
	lines with indices from 00 up to 99 and implements the Red Book
	specification for audio CDs that way. Patch by Vegard Pettersen
	<vegard_p at broadpark adot no>.

2004-09-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract: bug fix: ASS was handled like SSA which is
	not correct in each case, especially when extracting it.

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The WAV writer was not endian safe.

2004-09-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The charset was not set correctly on Solaris.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge crashed when reading Matroska files
	that contain an empty tag list.

2004-09-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Some Matroska files that e.g. have had their
	timecodes offset with the Matroska Stream Editor or other means
	may contain timecodes that caused mkvmerge to print a warning
	about "timecode < last_timecode". A new fix implements a
	workaround and a warning message with a proper explanation for
	this case.

2004-09-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Older Matroska files containing chapters
	caused mkvmerge to abort muxing.

2004-09-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge was only copying the last tag of a
	list of tags applying to a track from a Matroska file.

2004-09-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: mkvmerge will show a nice warning if the
	entries in a SRT have non-continuous timestamps. It'll also sort
	the entries by their start timestamp instead of throwing the
	generic "timecode < previous timecode" warning.

	* mmg: bug fix: The 'Matroska file analysis' window that occurs
	when reading chapters from a Matroska file did not disappear if it
	was minimized when the process finished.

2004-09-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added a new parameter
	--aspect-ratio-factor.

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Strings from chapters and tags were shown in
	UTF-8 instead of the local charset. This bug was introduced around
	2004-08-28.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Not all chapter elements were copied
	correctly from a source Matroska file.

2004-09-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: Sped up the extraction of attachments, chapters,
	cuesheets and tags by using the seek head information and not
	parsing the full file each time.

2004-09-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Matroska reader was not handling very big
	cluster timecodes correctly. Those can occur when the timecode
	scale factor is very small.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Empty clusters in Matroska files no longer
	make mkvmerge think that file has been read completely.

2004-08-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for MP2 (and maybe MP3)
	audio in MP4 containers.

2004-08-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: The chapter and tag parsers accept XML
	element attributes instead of sub-elements for those sub-elements
	that only contain data. Example for a "simple tag":
	<Simple Name="ARTIST" String="Tori Amos"/>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The automatic MIME type detection based on
	the file name extension was using the file name extension as the
	MIME type.

2004-08-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvinfo: new feature: Added the four new PixelCrop
	elements.

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract, mkvinfo: new feature: Added
	'TargetTypeValue' as a supported tagging element.

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract, mkvinfo: Complete rewrite of the chapter
	and tag parsing and output functions. Additions will be much
	easier now.

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract, mkvinfo: feature removed: Dropped support
	for the very old and deprecated tagging system. No one used it
	anyway.

2004-08-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Allow the use of two-letter ISO639-1
	country codes in for the '--language' parameter. Those will be
	converted to the corresponding ISO639-2 language code
	automatically.

2004-08-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvinfo, mkvextract: new feature: Added support for
	the 'TargetType' tag element (which I meant to add before the
	0.9.5 release...).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The MP3 handling was broken on weird and rare
	occasions when reading MP3 from a Matroska file.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Removed a bogus warning about an attachment's
	MIME type having been given more than once.

2004-08-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.9.5.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: WAV files which contained a 'PAD ' chunk
	before the 'data' chunk were not processed at all.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Use 'setjmp' and 'longjmp' Instead of
	throwing a C++ exception during the chapter parsing
	stage. Otherwise libexpat will abort with a non-descriptive error
	message on Windows.

2004-08-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: SSA/ASS subs with the old codec ID 'S_SSA'
	and 'S_ASS' were accepted, but their codec ID was kept. It is now
	correctly changed to 'S_TEXT/SSA' and 'S_TEXT/ASS'.

2004-08-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvinfo, mkvextract: new feature: Added support for
	the new 'EditionFlagHidden', 'EditionFlagDefault' and
	'EditionManaged' elements.

	* mkvmerge: Added 'EditionUID' to valid elements below '<Targets>'
	in XML tags. Fixed the creation of the 'Targets' with
	--global-tags and --tags.

2004-08-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvinfo, mkvextract: Added support for the new tag
	elements ('tag language' and 'default/original language').

	* mkvmerge: new feature: If there was no MIME type given for an
	attachment then mkvmerge will try to guess it based on the file's
	extension just like mmg.

2004-08-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract, mmg: Changes to the chapter
	handling. EditionUIDs are always created. mkvextract outputs
	EditionUIDs and ChapterUIDs normally. mkvmerge tries to keep
	EditionUIDs and ChapterUIDs but replaces them if they aren't
	unique.

2004-08-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The 'down' button on the 'input' tab was not
	working correctly in all cases.

2004-08-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo, mmg: bug fix: Fixed compilation with Unicode enabled
	versions of wxWidgets.

2004-08-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Try to guess whether tags read from OGM
	files (for automatic language tag setting and for copying chapter
	information) are already in UTF-8 or not. If not try to convert
	them from the current system's charset.

2004-08-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: use the same UID for the EditionUID in the
	chapters and in the tag targets when parsing a CUE sheet.

2004-08-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge/mkvextract: new feature: Use the new EditionUID entries
	when convert CUE sheets to chapters and tracks. This is in
	preparation for 'multiple CDs to single Matroska file'
	conversions.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Abort muxing if the output file name is
	the same as the name of one of the input files.

2004-08-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Implemented sample-precision for
	timestamps and durations on audio only files.

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The CUE extraction wrote UTF-8 characters
	but no UTF-8 BOM (byte order marker) at the beginning.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Handle TTA files with ID3 tags correctly ( =
	skip the ID3 tags).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: There was an illegal free() in the OGM
	reader.

2004-07-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: The subtitle track extraction used the wrong
	duration in 0.9.4.

2004-07-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Limited support for extracting chapters
	as CUE sheets that haven't been created by using a CUE sheet with
	mkvmerge's "--chapters" option.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Block durations with 0s length (e.g. entries
	in a SSA file) were not written.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The FLAC packetizer gets the duration
	from the FLAC packet itself.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The word 'TAG' occuring in e.g. SRT subs
	caused the ID3/MP3 frame detection to be stuck n an endless loop.

2004-07-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.9.4.

2004-07-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added support for extracting TTA tracks
	to TTA files.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: SRT file recognition failed if the file
	contained spaces at the end of the first line.

2004-07-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Implemented the extraction of chapter
	information and tags as a CUE sheet which is the reverse operation
	to using a CUE sheet with mkvmerge's '--chapters' parameter.

2004-07-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Broken VobSub .idx files which contain
	timestamps going backwards no longer crash mkvmerge. A warning
	will be printed for such inconsistencies.

2004-07-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Matroska reader contained a nice little
	illegal memory access (introduced in 0.9.3 with the fixes to the
	'default track' handling).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The SSA reader was segfaulting if a line
	contained an empty text field.

	* mmg: new feature: Added support for the two flags 'hidden' and
	'enabled' in the chapter editor.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: The pregap from a CUE sheet is converted
	into two sub-chapters (one for "INDEX 00", one for "INDEX
	01"). These sub-chapters have their 'hidden' flag set.

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Fixed compilation for MATROSKA_VERSION = 2.

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: Fixed compilation with gcc 3.2.

2004-07-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The CUE sheet parser interpreted a timestamp
	as HH:MM:SS (hours, minutes, seconds). The correct spec is
	HH:MM:FF (hours, minutes, frames with 1 frame = 1/75 second).

	* Released v0.9.3.

	* mmg: bug fix: The 'default track' checkbox was broken.

2004-07-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Using '--cues ...:all' was broken for audio
	tracks that use lacing.

2004-07-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The latest OpenDML AVI files generated by
	mencoder were not read correctly. Only the first RIFF chunk was
	processed.

2004-07-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: If the user does not specify a --language for a track
	'und' ('undefined') will now be used instead of 'eng'. The
	user can use the new option '--default-language' to change that.

2004-07-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: When using a CUE sheet as a chapter file
	mkvmerge will automatically convert some of the entries to tags.

2004-07-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The default track feature did not work
	correctly with the new --track-order.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for TTA lossless audio
	files.

2004-06-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.9.2.

	* mmg: Updated the mkvmerge GUI guide to reflect changes and
	additions.

2004-06-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added 'minimize' buttons to the two 'mkvmerge
	is running' dialogs.

	* mmg: new feature: Added an option for automatically calling
	'File -> new' after a job has been added to the job queue.

2004-06-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Video extraction was not working correctly
	on big endian systems.

2004-06-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The job manager did not always catch all of
	mkvmerge's output, especially if a job failed.

2004-06-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mmg: new feature: --track-order now controls the track
	creation order globally, meaning that it isn't used for each file
	but only once. This allows the tracks to be created in ANY order
	(before it was first ordered by file, then by track). For mmg this
	means that the track list contains all available tracks and that
	there are no 'up' and 'down' buttons in the file list anymore.

	* mmg: new feature: Line wrap the tooltips on Windows.

	* mmg: new feature: Suggest a name for a new job based on the
	output file name.

	* mmg: new feature: Temporarily disaable 'always on top' if the
	muxing or the job dialog are visible.

	* mmg: new feature: Ask for confirmation before adding a job if
	there's already an old job with the same description.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: You can specifiy the time after which to
	split with ms precision.

2004-06-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The functions 'move up', 'move down' and 'delete'
	in the 'job' dialog were not working correctly on Windows.

2004-06-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed more of that 'garbage at the beginning
	of MP3 streams' issue.

2004-06-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The 'always on top' option was ignored when
	starting mmg.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Reading of broken / unfinished AVI files was
	broken on Windows.

	* Released v0.9.1.

	* mkvmerge: Dropped supoprt for 'aviclasses' (one of the two
	libraries for accessing AVI files). This mostly affects the
	Windows users as I've used aviclasses and not avilib on Windows so
	far. The 0.9.0-pre-builds so far haven't shown any problems,
	though, so I hope this doesn't break anything.

	* mmg: bug fix: The job manager did not handle the conversion
	of non-ASCII characters correctly.

	* mmg: new feature: The action 'delete job' in the job manager
	will also delete the file in the 'jobs' subdirectory.

2004-06-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added an option to make mmg stay always on
	top (only on Windows).

	* mkvmerge: new feature: mmg will set the 'display dimensions'
	automatically for AVI files whose video track is MPEG4 and has the
	pixel aspect ratio stored in the bitstream.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The improved MP3 garbage detection was broken
	resulting in an error message from mkvmerge in some weird
	situations.

2004-06-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Matroska tracks can use lacing (several
	frames inside one Matroska block with only one timecode for the
	whole block). mkvmerge did not recreate the timecodes for the
	frames 1..n in the lacing correctly.

2004-06-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: feature removed: Dropped support for 'time
	slices'. They were not used, didn't offer the player any
	additional value and caused massive increase in overhead.

	* mmg: new feature: Added a dialog for adding arbitrary command
	line options which includes a list of advanced options to chose
	from.

2004-06-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The OGM fix in 0.9.0 broke handling for
	non-broken OGM files a bit.

2004-06-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added support for the audio/video
	synchronization method used by NanDub (garbage at the beginning of
	audio tracks inside an AVI) for AC3 and MPEG audio tracks. In
	other words: If an AVI is read and an audio track contains garbage
	right at the beginning then the corresponding audio delay is
	calculated and used instead of simply discarding the garbage.

2004-06-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Enabled reading MPEG4 video from MP4
	files (nope, they're not stored in Matroska's native mode yet).

2004-05-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.9.0.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Improved handling for OGM files. Streams that
	are lacking the comment packet are handled better.

2004-05-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Some MP3 streams are padded in the front with
	trash (mostly those in AVI files). This trash might contain valid
	MP3 headers which do not match the remaining headers for the
	actual track. Both the MP3 reader and the MP3 packetizer can now
	skip up to one of those bogus headers in the trash.

2004-05-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: On some occasions the chapter editor thought there
	was no language associated with a chapter name and complained
	about that.

	* mmg: Removed the 'advanced' tab. Those options shouldn't be used
	anyway.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The OGM reader was not endian safe.

2004-05-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Rewrite of the VobSub handling code.

2004-05-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The chapter editor did not honor the values
	selected for 'country' and 'language'.

2004-05-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Audio sync for Vorbis was partially broken
	for positive offsets.

2004-05-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Fix for compilation with wxWindows < 2.4.2.

	* Released v0.8.9.

	* mmg: new feature: mmg will ask for confirmation before
	overwriting a file. This can be turned off on the settings tab.

2004-05-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Implement drag'n'drop of files onto the input,
	attachment and chapter tabs. For the input and attachment tabs it
	works like pressing the 'add' button. On the chapters tab it works
	like calling 'Chapter Editor -> Open'.

2004-05-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo/mmg: Enabled compilation with wxWidgets 2.5 and Unicode
	enabled builds of wxWidgets.

2004-04-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: Increased the precision for timecodes in chapter files to
	nanoseconds (optionally, you can still use fewer digits after the
	'.').

2004-04-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Fixes for compilation with gcc 3.4.

2004-04-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Some strings read from RealMedia files were
	not zero-terminated resulting in broken track recognition for some
	files.

2004-04-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.8.8.

	* mkvtoolnix now depends on libebml 0.7.0 and libmatroska 0.7.0.

2004-04-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: bug fix: mkvinfo was forcing libmatroska not to handle
	unknown elements and crashed on those.

2004-04-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: When adding Matroska files the video track's
	display dimensions are displayed as well.

2004-04-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Implemented reading AAC from AVIs.

2004-04-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Flac packetizer was accessing
	uninitialized memory resulting in a crash on Windows.

	* avilib: bug fix: Fixed compilation on big endian systems.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed the handling of RealMedia files with
	'multirate' tracks (again).

2004-04-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: On some rare occasions chapters were not
	written correctly when splitting was active.

2004-04-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: On non-Windows systems some combinations of
	wxWindows and GTK caused continuous 100% CPU usage after a special
	call to wxExecute.

2004-04-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.8.7.

2004-04-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: new feature: Added a terse output format via '-s'.

2004-03-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: If using MPEG4 video and no aspect
	ratio or display dimensions are given mkvmerge will extract the
	aspect ratio information from the stream and automatically set the
	display dimensions accordingly.

2004-03-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Using audio sync on AC3 tracks read from
	Matroska files did not work.

2004-03-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Added extraction of RealAudio and
	RealVideo tracks to RealMedia files.

2004-03-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a 'job queue'. The current settings can
	be added as a new job, and all pending jobs can be started for
	batch processing without user interaction.

2004-03-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.8.6.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: OGMs created by Cyrius OGMuxer are missing
	comment packets for some streams which mkvmerge choked on.

2004-03-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge/mmg: bug fix: The LANGUAGE and TITLE comments from OGM
	files were not set in the GUI when adding such files.

2004-03-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: If the FourCC was set for one track it had been
	used for each track you selected as well.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Tags are being kept when reading Matroska
	files.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Large values for --sync (over 2100) would
	cause an integer overflow resulting in no sync being done at all.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The VobSub handling was broken if the .idx
	file contains an entry for a track ("id: en") but no "timestamp:"
	entries for such a track.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The segment UID was not generated if
	splitting was off.

	* mmg: new feature: Automatically set the output file name when
	the first file is added to the same name but with a '.mkv'
	extension if it hasn't been set yet. Can be disabled on the
	'settings' page.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: More of the non-ASCII character fixes (in
	--tags and --chapters this time).

	* mkvmerge/mmg: new feature: Made the process priority selectable
	on the 'settings' page and default to 'normal' again (was 'lower'
	before).

2004-03-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: mmg will ask for confirmation before
	overwriting an existing output file.

2004-02-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: No memory was allocated for the
	--attachment-description resulting in weird descriptions or
	mkvmerge aborting with 'invalid UTF-8 characters'.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: More of the non-ASCII characters fixes.

2004-02-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: File names with non-ASCII characters like
	Umlaute are handled correctly.

2004-02-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Some RealMedia files contain several tracks
	for multirate stuff which are now ignored. Only tracks with known
	MIME types (audio/x-pn-realaudio and video/x-pn-realvideo) are
	used.

2004-02-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Added a list of 'popular' languages on top of all language
	drop down boxes.

2004-02-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.8.5.

2004-02-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: segfault in the RealMedia reader.

	* mmg: bug fix: When adding a Matroska file that contains a track
	name or a title with non-ASCII characters those would be displayed
	as UTF-8 in the appropriate input boxes. This has been changed,
	but obviously it won't work if you add files with Japanese
	characters on a system with a different locale. For full Unicode
	support you'll have to wait quite a bit longer.

	* mmg: bug fix: For some 'browse file' buttons the default
	directory was not set to the last directory a file was selected
	from.

2004-02-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a function for adjusting the chapter
	timecodes by a fixed amount.

2004-02-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Splitting by size would sometimes abort
	directly after opening the second file.

2004-02-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Splitting by time was broken.

2004-02-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* all: A couple of changes that allow compilation on MacOS X.

	* avilib: synchronized with transcode's current CVS version.

2004-02-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.8.4.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: When reading Matroska files the durations
	attached to blocks were lost (e.g. for subtitle tracks).

2004-02-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.8.3.

2004-02-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: The LANGUAGE, TITLE tags and chapters are
	being kept when reading OGM files.

	* mkvmerge: Changed the meaning of '--global-tags'. They now apply
	to the complete file.

2004-02-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: VobSub durations were not converted from ms
	to ns precision resulting in VERY short packets :)

2004-02-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The change from ms to ns precision broke
	subtitle handling from OGM.

2004-01-31  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Made "do not link files when splitting" the default,
	just like in mmg.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Enabled reading of AAC from OGMs.

	* mkvmerge: The VobSub reader will not discard packets that exceed
	a certain size (64KB) anymore.

	* mkvmerge: Improved some internal memory freeing decisions. This
	should help with files/sections in which are only few keyframes.

2004-01-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changed the two-pass splitting into a one-pass
	splitting. The resulting files will always be a little bit larger
	than the desired size/length, but this shouldn't matter.

2004-01-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Segfault when using external timecode v1
	files.

2004-01-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Rewrote the chapter editor. It now makes a lot more sense:
	You can have multiple names for one chapter entry, and for each
	name there's only one language/country association.

2004-01-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The AAC-in-Real stuff again.

2004-01-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changed the complete timecode handling from ms
	precision to ns precision. Expect some things to be broken by
	this change.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Fixed a couple of memory leaks, especially in
	the QuickTime/MP4 parser.

2004-01-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Added some more extensions for RealMedia files.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Proper handling for AAC read from RealMedia
	files (sample rate/output sample rate were not assigned
	correctly).

	* Released v0.8.2.

2004-01-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The PCM handling was broken resulting in
	packets that did not end on sample boundaries.

2004-01-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: AVIs with uncompressed sound were leading to
	buffer overflows.

	* mkvmerge/mmg: allow the track names to be empty so that you can
	remove them when muxing Matroska files. Same for the file title.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: The track headers will be rendered
	completely including the elements that are set to their default
	values. Causes less confusion and allows the setting of e.g. the
	track language without having to remux the file completely.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If remuxing a file that contains frames with
	a reference to the same timecode those references were lost
	turning such P frames into I frames. This was the case for some
	RealAudio stuff.

2004-01-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Automatically pre-set the attachment's MIME
	type if the file has a known extension (e.g. 'text/plain' for
	'.txt').

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Unknown/unsupported track types can be
	copied 1:1 from Matroska input files.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added proper support for
	AAC-inside-RealMedia files.

2004-01-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Write cues for audio-only files as well
	(not more than one cue entry during a two seconds period).

2004-01-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The default track flags could not be
	overriden on the command line when reading Matroska files.

	* Windows binaries after v0.8.1 require a new runtime DLL
	archive. Please download it from
	http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/ Thanks.

2004-01-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added the two new chapter flags 'hidden'
	and 'enabled'.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added a new format for the external
	timecode files.

2004-01-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The VobSub handling was on occasion putting
	SPU packets for the wrong MPEG stream into the current stream
	resulting in that particular entity not being displayed.

2004-01-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.8.1.

2004-01-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The I/O classes were not initialized
	correctly on Windows resulting in spontaneous strange error
	messages, especially when muxing VobSubs.

2004-01-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: For some special atom sizes in Quicktime and
	MP4 files the size was not read correctly. This affected
	e.g. files created by Nero Digital.

2004-01-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Segfault when muxing some video formats due
	to unchecked data (includes RealVideo).

2004-01-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.8.0.

2003-12-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Fixed the "write chapters to Matroska file"
	feature.

	* mmg: bug fix: Made mmg not abort but only display an error
	message when malformed XML chapter files should be loaded.

2003-12-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The timescodes for Vorbis were calculated one
	packet too early (meaning that the first packet did not start at
	0).

	* mmg: Made "don't link" ON by default because some players might
	have problems with the second and all following files if they
	don't expect them not to start at 0.

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract, mkvinfo: Added support for the new tagging
	system.

	* mmg: bug fix: The default values for the chapter language and
	chapter country are now applied when loading simple (OGM) style
	chapter files as well.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The VobSub packetizer will assume MPEG2 if no
	MPEG version identifier was found ("Unsupported MPEG version:
	0x00...").

2003-12-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: There are MP4 files that actually contain HE-AAC but
	don't have the 5 byte identifier. mkvmerge will also assume SBR if
	there's only the 2 byte identifier with a sampling frequency <
	44100Hz.

2003-12-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Wrong display output and illegal memory
	access when extracting FLAC files.

2003-12-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: If one added a Matroska file and the track name or
	language of a track consisted of only blanks then mmg would
	segfault.

2003-12-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: The input box will automatically select the first track
	when a file is selected. Upon track selection the input focus is
	set to the track name input box.

	* mmg: The chapter editor automatically focuses the chapter name
	input box whenever a chapter entry is selected.

	* mmg: bug fix: The chapter editor did not properly escape the
	chapter names resulting in invalid XML files if the special
	characters &, < or > were used.

2003-12-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If splitting was active then a wrong CodecID
	was written to the second and all following files for MP2 tracks.

2003-12-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.7.9.

2003-12-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Set the thread priority to BELOW_NORMAL on Windows
	(mkvmerge was already nice(2)'d on Unix systems).

	* mmg: bug fix: Removed the Ctrl-v and Ctrl-c accelerators that I
	used for mmg functions which overrode the usual 'paste' and 'copy'
	functionality.

	* mmg: Command line arguments are put into an option file which is
	then handed over to mkvmerge. This allows really long command
	lines, even on Windows.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Negative track IDs in Ogg files were reported
	incorrectly for mkvmerge -i (which affected the GUI).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Internal changes had messed up the --language
	and --track-name functionality.

2003-12-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added "up" and "down" buttons for the tracks,
	too.

	* mmg: new feature: Added a menu option, 'set output file', that
	can be used as an alternative to the "browse" button at the bottom
	(for those poor users with nothing more than 800x600 ;)).

	* mkvmerge: new feature: The user can alter the order in which the
	tracks for an input file are put into the output file with the new
	"--track-order" option.

	* mmg: bug fix: The "AAC is SBR" check box was grayed out for AAC
	inside MP4 files.

2003-12-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The "load settings" function did not load all
	settings, and some strings were not allocated at all resulting in
	a crash when a track was removed after loading these settings.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The AAC packetizer was not working if packets
	were being read from a raw AAC file (it worked fine from MP4 and
	Matroska files).

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Avoid deadlocks when parsing broken SPU
	packets from VobSubs.

	* mmg: new feature: Added buttons for moving input files up and
	down in the input file box.

2003-12-02  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.7.8.

	* mmg: new feature: You can set the values for the language and/or
	country codes for a chapter and all its children with the push of
	one button (the new "Set values" button).

	* mmg: new feature: You can set default values for the language
	and the country codes in the chapter editor (Chapter menu -> Set
	default values).

2003-12-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Display dimensions were sometimes off by one,
	e.g. 640x479 instead of 640x480. This should not happen anymore
	for sane pixel dimensions.

	* mkvmerge: Changed the options '--fourcc' and
	'--aspect-ratio'. They now take a track ID just like all the other
	track specific options.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added an option '--display-dimensions'
	which allows the direct setting of the display dimensions. It is
	mutually exclusive with '--aspect-ratio', of course.

2003-11-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The language combo box was not correctly set on
	Windows.

2003-11-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added an option for dumpig all split points including
	file size and timestamp information after the first splitting
	pass.

2003-11-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Quotes were missing if the timecode file's name
	contained spaces.

2003-11-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Rewrote the SPU packet parsing code. It should not
	abort anymore.

	* everything: Committed a lot of cross-OS compatibility fixes
	(thanks to Haali and thedj).

2003-11-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.7.7.

	* mkvextract: Added extraction of FLAC to raw FLAC or OggFLAC
	files.

	* mkvmerge: Added full support for FLAC (both raw FLAC and OggFLAC
	are supported, even though raw FLAC is very slow).

2003-11-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Added an input field for the 'CUE sheet to chapter name'
	conversion format.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Reworked the audio sychronization which did
	not work correctly for Matroska source files.

2003-11-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Increased the size of the space reserved for
	the first meta seek element (see mkvmerge.1 for an
	explanation). In some situations (with tags, chapters,
	attachements and very big file) it might not have been enough in
	order to contain all elements.

2003-11-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Added an input field for the 'timecodes' file to the track
	options.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: When reading MP3 audio tracks from a Matroska
	file with the A_MS/ACM CodecID (MS compatibility mode) the layer
	was not identified correctly.

	* mkvmerge: Improved the file type detection for AC3 and AAC files
	a bit.

	* mkvmerge: Implemented a lot of fixes for big endian systems and
	processors that don't allow non-aligned memory access for word or
	bigger sized objects.

	* mmg: Made mmg accept return codes of 1 when 'mkvmerge -i' is run
	when an input file is added. This way mmg won't reject mkvmerge's
	output if mkvmerge only printed some warnings which will result in
	a return code of 1 instead of 0.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If running in identification mode (-i, used
	by mmg a lot) then don't output any warnings or mmg will not
	accept this file.

2003-11-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: CUE sheets can be used for chapters.

2003-11-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added support for --sync for VobSub tracks.

	* mkvtoolnix: Re-worked the configure script. Removed all the lib
	specific --with-...-include and --with-...-lib options. The
	--with-extra-includes and --with-extra-libs options can be used
	instead.

2003-11-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: When a file is being added then some information from it
	(languages, track names, file title) are kept, and the appropriate
	input boxes are pre-set with these values. Works only for formats
	that support such information (Matroska, VobSub).

	* mkvmerge: Sped up the reading of VobSub .idx files.

2003-11-05  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.7.5.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The VobSub .idx parser was dividing by 0 if
	a track only contained one entry.

	* mkvmerge: Fixed the timecode reader code and made it a bit more
	flexible. Added more documentation for this feature along with an
	example file (examples/example-timecodes.txt).

	* mmg: bug fix: When 'default track' is selected then all other
	tracks of the same type will have their 'default track' flag
	cleared.

	* mkvmerge: SPU packets belonging to the same timecode are grouped
	together, and the duration is extracted directly from the SPU
	stream.

2003-10-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: The VobSubs are now stripped of the MPEG program
	stream, and only the SPU packets are kept.

2003-10-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge, mkvextract: The Matroska reader and the OGM reader
	(mkvmerge) as well as mkvextract will discard empty or 'cleaning
	only' subtitle packets as they are appear in OGMs in order to mark
	the end of an entry.

2003-10-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Added the ability to read timecodes from
	text files which override the timecodes mkvmerge calculates
	normally.

2003-10-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Add all the mandatory elements when
	extracting chapters so that the resulting XML can always be used
	directly with mkvmerge again without having to manually add
	e.g. ChapterLanguage.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix; Handle audio tracks from Matroska files with
	the CodecID A_MS/ACM correctly.

2003-10-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changes to use libmatroska's new lacing code.

2003-10-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The VobSub .idx parser was mis-calculating
	the subtitle entry frame sizes.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: The Vorbis packetizer was miscalculating the
	number of samples to add/remove when using audio sync.

2003-10-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a new menu entry "File -> new" which
	will clear all the current muxing settings.

	* mmg: Added support for VobSub subtitles including their
	compression options. Added the .m4a extension to the 'add file'
	dialog.

	* mmg: bug fix: Made the input boxes for file names (tags and
	chapters) editable so that their contents can be deleted.

	* mkvmerge: Adjusted the compression handling to the final content
	encoding specs.

2003-10-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Implemented generic support for frame
	compression (mostly useful for VobSub subtitles but could also be
	used for others) and the complete framework for handling content
	encodings in the Matroska reader.

2003-10-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: new feature: Dump unknown elements recursively.

2003-10-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: Made the SRT reader more tolerant regarding
	empty lines.

2003-10-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.7.2.

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: If 'no linking' and splitting was active
	mkvmerge would abort on the start of the second output file due to
	timecodes that were calculated incorrectly.

	* mkvmerge: Implemented some speedups for a couple of container
	formats and track types (mainly AVI reader, MP3/AC3/AAC
	packetizers). Especially noticeable when splitting is active as
	well.

2003-10-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: bug fix: Support for extracting SBR AAC (previous
	'fix' did not actually fix this).

	* mkvextract: bug fix: All extracted subtitles where written to
	the first output file given, not to the one they were supposed to
	be written to.

2003-10-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: The 'abort' button was doing nothing under
	Windows.

2003-10-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bug fix: Audio, video and subtitle track selection was
	translated into the wrong command line options.

	* mkvmerge: Replaced the avilib based AVI reading functions with
	AVI classes from Cyrius.

2003-10-03  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.7.1.

	* Added a guide for mmg including some pictures.

2003-10-01  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changed the lacing strategy again. New defaults are
	NOT to write duration elements for all blocks, NOT to use time
	slices and to USE lacing for most audio tracks. This will save
	some space. The downside is that the laced frames 'lose' their
	precise timecode information. Current demuxers don't care and will
	work nevertheless. More sophisticated applications that make use
	of these advanced information (duration elements, time slices) are
	not available at the moment. All these options can be toggled by
	the user with the new/modified options --disable-lacing,
	--enable-durations and --enable-timeslices.

2003-09-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: new feature: Attachments are kept when reading
	Matroska files.

2003-09-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: new feature: Added a (nearly) full-featured chapter editor.

2003-09-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix: XML chapters were not parsed correctly.

2003-09-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bug fix/new feature: Rewrote the complete MP3
	handling. Now files with ID3 tags (both v1 and v2) are handled
	correctly. All MPEG-1 audio files (all layers) should be handled
	correctly now.

2003-09-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: new feature: Support for extract HE-AAC tracks to
	.aac files. Bug fix: Missing elements (default values) are handled
	correctly for audio tracks.

2003-09-19  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: bugfix: If attachments were given with path components
	then the path component wasn't discarded for the attachment's
	description on Windows (normally only the file name should be used
	as the attachment's name).

	* mmg: Fixed wrong order of the options --chapters,
	--chapter-language and --chapter-charset.

2003-09-17  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: Added a lot of checks on the data given by the user so that
	invalid data is reported by mmg and not by mkvmerge.

	* mmg: Made the app a GUI app which gets rid of the "DOS box" on
	Windows.

2003-09-16  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mmg: bugfix: Moved the aspect ratio and FourCC input fields from
	the global tab to the input tab where they belong to.

	* mkvmerge: new feature: RealAudio can be read from Matroska
	files.

	* mkvmerge: bugfix: RealVideo was not read correctly from Matroska
	files.

	* mkvmerge: bugfix: The SRT reader would abort if there was more
	than one empty line between subtitle entries line.

	* mkvextract: bugfix: Proper BOMs are written according to the
	desired charset when extracting text subtitles.

	* Released v0.7.0.

	* mkvextract: Add an UTF-8 BOM to extracted SSA/ASS and SRT
	subtitle files. Print warnings for missing durations for text
	subtitle tracks.

2003-09-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Added a complete GUI for mkvmerge, mkvmergeGUI (mmg) based on
	the work of Florian Wagner.

2003-09-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Support for setting the track names.

	* mkvmerge: For Matroska source files: If the source contains
	chapters then these are kept unless the user specified chapters
	with --chapters.

2003-09-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Implemented an experimental VobSub reader and
	packetizer. No specs exist for these yet, though.

	* mkvmerge: Improved the support for Matroska files with tracks
	with big gaps between entries, e.g. subtitle tracks whose entries
	are a minute or more apart.

	* mkvmerge: When splitting is active and the source is a Matroska
	file then splitpoints were borked, and the first pass was slow as
	your average mole.

	* mkvmerge: The track UIDs are kept when reading Matroska files
	even when splitting is active.

2003-09-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added a QuickTime/MP4 reader. Can handle several
	QuickTime video and QuickTime audio formats as well as AAC (both
	'normal' AAC and SBR AAC).

2003-09-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight are kept intact when
	reading from a Matroska file but can be overridden with
	--aspect-ratio.

2003-08-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Wrote documentation, XML examples and the DTD for the XML
	chapter files.

	* mkvinfo: Rewrote mkvinfo to use libebml's Read() function
	instead of manually reading each and every element.

	* mkvmerge: Added support for XML based chapter files.

2003-08-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.6.5.

2003-08-28  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: On Windows the 'isspace()' function used to trim
	leading and trailing white spaces from tags considered some parts
	of valid UTF-8 character sequences to be white spaces as
	well. Fixed by replacing 'isspace()' with 'isblank()'. Reported
	by Liisachan.

	* mkvmerge: Support for chosing the charset and language used in
	simple chapter files. Suggestion by Liisachan.

	* Rewrote the UTF-8 conversion routines. They should now handle
	U+8000 characters correctly. Reported by Liisachan.

	* mkvmerge: Real reader: For RV40 the actual dimensions were also
	used for the aspect ratio/display dimensions. This has been fixed:
	the actual dimensions are used for PixelWidth/PixelHeight, the
	dimensions stored in the RM container are used for the aspect
	ratio/DisplayWidth & DisplayHeight. Reported by Karl Lillevold.

2003-08-27  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.6.4.

	* mkvextract: Support for re-creating dropped frames when
	extracting video to an AVI. Works only well if the frame durations
	in the source file are multiples of the frame rate, of course.

	* mkvmerge: The MP3 packetizer did not start at 0 with its
	timecodes. It does now. Reported by alexnoe.

	* mkvmerge: Proper support for dropped frames when reading AVI
	files. Reported by alley_cat, Horváth István.

	* mkvmerge: Fixed some missing default values in the Matroska
	reader (e.g. mono audio files). Reported by Liisachan.

2003-08-25  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Improved all command line parsing error messages.

	* mkvmerge: Improved the error message for the XML tag file parser
	if an invalid &-sequence is found.

	* mkvextract: Strings are postprocessed so that the special
	characters &, <, >, " are replaced by their HTML equivalents
	&amp;, &lt, &gt; and &quot;.

2003-08-24  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Disabled lacing by default and renamed --no-lacing to
	--enable-lacing. With all the proper info about the laced frames
	lacing is actually producing larger files than without lacing.

	* mkvmerge: Meta seek element is split into two elements. The
	first's located at the start of the file containing only a small
	number of level 1 elements. The clusters are referenced in a
	second meta seek element located at the end of the file. Removed
	the options "--meta-seek-size" and "--no-meta-seek". Added the
	option to disable that second meta seek entry,
	"--no-clusters-in-meta-seek".

2003-08-22  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: Backwards compatibility: Accepts S_SSA and S_ASS as
	valid CodecIDs (new CodecIDs are S_TEXT/SSA and S_TEXT/ASS).

	* mkvmerge: Bugfix: If a subtitle packet was the last packet in a
	cluster then its duration was not written resulting in a broken file.

2003-08-21  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: Added support for the following elements:
	KaxPrevFilename, KaxNextFilename, KaxTrackFlagEnabled,
	KaxTrackName, KaxCodecName, KaxCodecSettings, KaxCodecInfoURL,
	KaxCodecDownloadURL, KaxCodecDecodeAll, KaxTrackOverlay,
	KaxAudioPosition, KaxAudioOutputSamplingFreq, KaxVideoDisplayUnit,
	KaxVideoColourSpace, KaxVideoGamma, KaxVideoFlagInterlaced,
	KaxVideoStereoMode, KaxVideoAspectRatio, KaxClusterPosition,
	KaxClusterPrevSize, KaxBlockVirtual, KaxBlockAdditions,
	KaxBlockMore, KaxBlockAddID, KaxBlockAdditional,
	KaxReferenceVirtual, KaxSliceBlockAddID, KaxChapters,
	KaxEditionEntry, KaxChapterAtom, KaxChapterUID,
	KaxChapterTimeStart, KaxChapterTimeEnd, KaxChapterTrack,
	KaxChapterTrackNumber, KaxChapterDisplay, KaxChapterString,
	KaxChapterLanguage, KaxChapterCountry

2003-08-20  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.6.3.

	* mkvmerge: The Real reader accepts incomplete video packets and
	tries to re-assemble them instead of aborting with 'die: len !=
	total'.

2003-08-18  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Implemented a switch that has to be used for SBR AAC /
	AAC+ / HE-AAC if the source file is an AAC file and the AAC file
	contains SBR AAC data (no automatic detection possible in this case!).

2003-08-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Low bitrate AC3 tracks from Real's DNET are identified
	as A_AC3/BSID9 or A_AC3/BSID10.

	* mkvmerge: The RealMedia reader takes the number of packets into
	account when reading which results in better end-of-file detection.

2003-08-12  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Windows versions: Fixed a bug with files bigger than 2GB not
	being recognized. The accompanying error message was "File NAME
	has unknown type. Please have a look at the supported file
	types..."

	* all tools: Fixed a bug which would only allow Matroska files up
	to 4GB to be read. The accompanying error message was "No segment
	found" or something similar.

	* mkvinfo: Unknown elements are properly skipped now.

2003-08-11  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: For RV40 (RealVideo 9) the actual video dimensions are
	decoded from the first video frame.

	* Released v0.6.2.

	* mkvmerge: Video aspect ratio was set wrong if the user did not
	specify any.

	* Released v0.6.1.

	* mkvmerge: RealVideo: Support for all kinds of frames including
	"short" and "merged" frames (results are identical to Gabest's
	output).

2003-08-10  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: The aspect ratio setting will only cause upscaling of
	the current video dimensions which are then put into
	KaxVideoDisplayWidth and KaxVideoDisplayHeight.

	* mkvextract: Changed how the global elements are handled by
	taking the parent's size into account. This re-enables processing
	of files produced with the latest VirtualDubMod.

	* mkvmerge: Changed how the Matroska reader handles global
	elements by taking the parent's size into account. This re-enables
	processing of files produced with the latest VirtualDubMod.

	* mkvinfo: Changed how mkvinfo handles global elements by taking
	the parent's size into account. Hopefully this is now correct.

	* mkvextract: Support for MultiComment tags.

	* mkvmerge: Fixed support for reading MultiComment tags from
	XML tag files.

	* mkvmerge: Allow some slightly broken Matroska files to be
	processed correctly if the reference blocks are off by at most 1ms.

2003-08-09  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: MP3: Better support for other MPEG versions and layers
	(number of samples per packet).

	* mkvinfo: Added Adler32 calculation and display for frame
	contents with the -c option.

	* mkvmerge: RealAudio: "dnet" is actually byte-swapped AC3 and is
	being treated as such (re-swapped and output as AC3).

	* mkvmerge: Fixed a bug with chapters and splitting which would
	crash mkvmerge if no chapter belonged into the output file.

2003-08-06  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Changes for compilation with gcc 2.95.

2003-08-04  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* Released v0.6.0.

2003-07-30  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	binary elements in the tags.

2003-07-29  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvextract: Support for extracting chapter information.

	CHAPTER01NAME=Hello World etc).

2003-07-26  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added support tags based on XML files.

	* mkvextract: Rewrote the command line syntax. Added extracting
	attachments and tags as new options.

	handle Unix/DOS style new line cases correctly.

2003-07-23  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added support for the "SegmentTitle" (general title of
	the file written).

	* mkvmerge: Added support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 encoded text files
	for the SRT and SSA/ASS readers.

2003-07-15  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: The SSA/ASS reader ignored the --sub-charset option
	and always used the current charset to recode the subtitles.

2003-07-14  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Added support for attaching files to the output
	file(s).

	* mkvinfo: Support for the elements dealing with attachments
	(KaxAttachments, KaxAttached, KaxFileDescription, KaxFileName,
	KaxMimeType, KaxFileData).

2003-07-13  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Changed the RealVideo packaging method: Subpackets are
	assembled into complete packets so the demuxer does not have to do
	that anymore.

	* mkvmerge: DisplayWidth and DisplayHeight, which form the display
	aspect ratio, are now always written to ease changing them later
	without having to completely remux the file.

2003-07-08  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvmerge: Fixed some infinite-reading-from-a-file bug that
	occured on Windows when reading SSA/ASS files.

	* mkvmerge: Fixed a bug which would mostly appear with subtitles
	that have very long ( > 60s) gaps between entries. Here the
	cluster would not been rendered properly leaving mkvmerge either
	comatose ( = endless loop) or just plain dead ( = crashing).

2003-07-07  Moritz Bunkus  <moritz@bunkus.org>

	* mkvinfo: Added support for the rest of the tags:
	KaxTagMultiComment, KaxTagMultiCommentName,

	* Removed "(mkvinfo) " from mkvinfo's output in order to improve
	readability and save space.
