== Summary

A simple framework for automatic parallelism.

== Synopsis
  
  require 'comp_tree'
  
  CompTree.build do |driver|

    # Define a function named 'area' taking these two arguments.
    driver.define(:area, :width, :height) { |width, height|
      width*height
    }
    
    # Define a function 'width' which takes a 'border' argument.
    driver.define(:width, :border) { |border|
      7 + border
    }
    
    # Ditto for 'height'.
    driver.define(:height, :border) { |border|
      5 + border
    }
    
    # Define a constant function 'border'.
    driver.define(:border) {
      2
    }
    
    # Compute the area using up to four parallel threads.
    puts driver.compute(:area, 4)
    # => 63

    # We've done this computation.
    puts((7 + 2)*(5 + 2))
    # => 63
  end

== Install

  % gem install comp_tree

Or from inside an unpacked .tgz download, <code>rake install</code> /
<code>rake uninstall</code>.

== Description

CompTree is a parallel computation tree structure based upon concepts
from pure functional programming.

CompTree has been tested on MRI versions 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.1, 1.9.2,
and jruby versions 1.4, 1.5, 1.6.

== Background

The user should have a basic understanding of functional programming
(see for example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
and the meaning of <em>side effects</em>.

Every function you define must explicitly depend on the data it uses.

  #
  # BAD example: depending on state -- offset not listed as a parameter
  #
  driver.define(:area, :width, :height) { |width, height|
    width*height - offset
  }

Unless <em>offset</em> is really a constant, the result of
<tt>driver.compute(:area, n)</tt> is not well-defined for _n_ > 1.

Just as depending on some changeable state is bad, it is likewise bad
to affect a state (to produce a <em>side effect</em>).

  #
  # BAD example: affecting state
  #
  driver.define(:area, :width, :height) { |width, height|
    accumulator.add "more data"
    width*height
  }

Given a tree where nodes are modifying _accumulator_, the end state of
_accumulator_ is not well-defined, even if _accumulator_ is a
thread-safe object.

Note however it is OK affect a state as long as <em>no other function
depends on that state</em>.  This is the principle under which
CompTree parallelizes Rake tasks (http://drake.rubyforge.org).
